Nuclear Fission Nucleus of an atom is bombarded with neutrons to split the heavier nucleus into smaller and lighter nuclei This makes the nucleus so unstable that it splits into 2 A lot of energy is released Occur artificially Little energy is required to split an atom Atomic bomb is based on concept of nuclear fission Often involves releases of gamma rays and free neutrons $$^1_0n+ ^{235}{92}U-&amp;gt;^{141}{56}Ba+^{92}_{36}Kr+3 ^1_0 n$$ Nuclear Fusion 2 or more lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus An enormous amount of energy is released, much larger than nuclear fission Occurs in stars and the sun Huge amount of energy is required to bring 2 atoms together Therefore, happens in very, very hot conditions Cold fusion is a concept that entails nuclear fusion happening at room temperature Hydrogen bomb is based on concept of nuclear fusion Usually releases neutrons or protons as well as new nucleus Strong magnetic field is required for magnetic confinement Ensures plasma doesn’t escape Confinement ensures that fusion occurs, and makes it safe Mass defect The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the combined masses of the nucleons Mass defect: difference between total mass of the individual nucleons, and the mass of the nucleus as a whole  The difference in mass is considered to be the binding energy of the nucleus We can calculate the energy through $e=mc^2$ e = energy in J m = mass in kg c = speed of light, or 300 000 000 m/s Binding Energy The difference in mass (mass defect) is considered to be binding energy If the mass of 4He was equal to the mass of 2 protons + 2 neutrons, the nucleus would fall apart without any input of energy To be stable, its mass must be less than that of its constituents combined  The nuclear binding energy represents the amount of energy that must be put into a nucleus to break it apart into its individual nucleons Nuclear Energy Element is bombarded with neutrons Neutrons are absorbed Nucleus becomes unstable and splits into smaller nuclei, radioactive energy and lone neutrons</description></item><item><title>Nuclear Physics</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/10Physics/NuclearPhysics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/10Physics/NuclearPhysics/</guid><description>go back
Atoms Central part of an atom is the nucleus Consists of: Neutrons No charge: 0 Relative Atomic Mass: 1 Protons Positive Charge + Relative Atomic Mass: 1 Collectively called nucleons Almost identical in mass and size Most of an atom is empty space that is only occupied by electrons Any change in the amount of protons changes the element  Electrons Negative Charge: - Relative Atomic Mass: 1/1836 Orbit nucleus at high speeds $$^A_ZX$$ A: Mass number No.</description></item><item><title>Nuclear Physics as a Human Endeavour</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/10Physics/NuclearPhysicsHumanEndeavours/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/10Physics/NuclearPhysicsHumanEndeavours/</guid><description>go back
Nuclear Power Stations Pros Energy efficient Small land footprint Average nuclear power plant producing 2000 MW takes up a square mile of space Very powerful, energy wise Reliable Produce their maximum power output 93% of the time Very stable Produces no greenhouse gases Cons Closely connected to nuclear weapon technology production/proliferation Dangerous to society Nuclear waste Extremely poisonous products Takes 10s of 1000s of years to stop being radioactive/poisonous Possibility of nuclear accidents Uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions Neutrons from fission reaction create another fission reaction Causes excess of energy in the form of heat Sometimes the heat is too much for the reactor to handle It melts, and radioactive waste is expelled Expensive to set up Uranium is expensive Nuclear Power Station Components Fuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium Moderator: material that slows down neutrons Graphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide Heavy water is the best but is too expensive Water with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen Graphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen Ensures that neutron capture occurs When the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy Control rods: material that absorbs neutrons Boron steel or cadmium Ensures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission Coolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down e.</description></item></channel></rss>
