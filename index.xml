Matter (elements) is composed of small, indivisible, particles called “atoms” All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties) Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds Atom is a sphere Disadvantages</description></item><item><title>Close Reading Structure</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Literature/CloseReading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Literature/CloseReading/</guid><description>go back

Vibrations Vibration: Mechanical phenomenon where oscillation occurs around an equilibrium point Free Vibration: When a force is applied to any object, then that object is allowed to vibrate at its natural frequency Forced Vibration: When a force is applied to an object and it is forced to vibrate at a particular frequency Natural frequency: frequency at which an object vibrates when it is not disturbed by an outside force Resonance Resonance: Phenomenon that occurs where an object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency Energy is transferred from the forced oscillator to the receiver with maximum efficiency, and the amplitude of the vibration is increased greatly Modes of Vibration The different ways in which a system vibrates naturally/oscillates The frequency of oscillation is termed as modal frequency.</description></item><item><title>Concentration</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/Concentration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/Concentration/</guid><description>$$C=\frac{n}{V}$$

Electrostatic force of attraction between shared pair of electrons and the nuclei on either side Non-metal atoms involved Covalent bonding: Non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons by overlapping valence shells to give each a nobel gas structure A covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons There is a force of attraction between the bonding pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms at each side Hydrogen atoms only need 2 electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium Octet Rule: Atoms gain, lose or share eelectrons when they combine with other atoms to acquire a stable octet (8) of electrons There are exceptions: $SF_6$ and $BCl_3$ Properties Non-conductors of electricity Electrons are localised in the electron cloud or as bonding pairs Therefore, they are immobile, and cannot conduct charge Bad conductors of heat No free particles that can move from one end of the particle to another, carrying kinetic energy (temperature) Thus, it is a bad conductor of heat Soft Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules and so these molecules can be easily separated and rearranged when a force is applied, making them soft Low melting/boiling point Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules Small amount of energy is need to overcome these bonds, and there is a low melting/boiling point These increase with molecular size, which increases the strength of the bonds Note: These are for Covalent Molecular Structures, not Covalent Network Structures, which you do not need to know .</description></item><item><title>Diffraction</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/Diffraction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/Diffraction/</guid><description> The bending/deformation of wave fronts as they pass through a gap or around an obstacle $\lambda &amp;gt;= d$ , where d is the distance of the gap</description></item><item><title>Electronic Configuration</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</guid><description>Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells

Ego-centric point of view Context Romanticism: attitude or intellectual orientation that characterised many works of literature, paintings, music, architecture and criticism in Western civilisation over a period from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century Can be seen as a rejection of the precepts of order, calm, harmony, balance, idealisation, and rationality that typified late 18th century Neo-classicism in particular Also a reaction against the Enlightenment and against 18th Century The Romantic Movement Freedom of the individual Rejection of restricting social conventions and political rule Fight for rights of the common man Emphasis on emotions and the imagination over reason and logic Free spontaneous action over controlled calculated behaviour Valorisation of the wilderness The “noble savage” Savage meaning people from other, non-Euro places Revival of interest on folklore and legends Chivalry As an aesthetic philosophy, Romanticism engages with these key concepts:</description></item><item><title>Scalars and Vectors</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/ScaVec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/ScaVec/</guid><description>go back

Superposition occurs when 2 waves travelling in the same medium meet Their amplitudes combine algebraically to produce a resultant wave at that particular instant When the 2 waves superimpose, the resultant displacement of the particles is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual displacements of the original waves Constructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are in phase interfere/superimpose Resultant wave has an amplitude greater than each of the individual waves Equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves Application: Amplified Speakers When 2 speakers are made to produce the same sound, the sound waves produced interfere with each other Thus, at certain places (anti-nodes), constructive interference occurs, and the sound is louder (amplitude increases) At nodes, destructive interference occurs, and the sound is quieter (amplitude decreases) Destructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are not in phase meet and superimpose, crating a resultant wave that has amplitude lower than each of the individual waves Here the individual waves have positive and negative amplitudes, and so they combine to produce a wave of smaller amplitude Complete Destructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are completely not in phase, i.</description></item><item><title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Specialist/PigeonholePrinciple/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Specialist/PigeonholePrinciple/</guid><description>go back
