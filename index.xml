Unique Spectra: As the discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique to each atom, the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element.</description></item><item><title>Atomic Structure</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Chemistry/AtomicStructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Chemistry/AtomicStructure/</guid><description>Go Back
John Dalton 1803-08: Proposed “Atomic Theory of Matter“
Matter (elements) is composed of small, indivisible, particles called “atoms” All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties) Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds Atom is a sphere Disadvantages</description></item><item><title>Chemistry Notes</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Chemistry/Chemistry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Chemistry/Chemistry/</guid><description>THESE NOTES ARE IN ORDER OF THE CONTENT COVERED, WITH INITIAL CONTENT AT THE TOP, AND FINAL CONTENT AT THE BOTTOM!</description></item><item><title>Economics Notes</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Economics/Economics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Economics/Economics/</guid><description>THESE NOTES ARE IN ORDER OF THE CONTENT COVERED, WITH INITIAL CONTENT AT THE TOP, AND FINAL CONTENT AT THE BOTTOM!</description></item><item><title>Electronic Configuration</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</guid><description>Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells

Macro-economics vs Micro-economics Macro-economics and Micro-economics are 2 of the largest subdivisions of the study of economics Micro- refers to the observation of small economics units Effects of government regulations on individual markets and consumer decision making Macro- refers to the “big picture” version of economics How interest rates are determined Why some economics grow faster than others Micro-economics Individual markets Consumers Producers/firrms Government How their actions influence decisions and individual markets Utility maximisation/satisfaction Firm production and profit maximisation Individual market equilibrium Effects of government regulations on individual markets Externalities and other side effects Macro-economics The big picture Focuses on aggregate production and consumption in an economy Effects of general taxes such as income and sales taxes on output and prices Causes of economics upswings and downturns Effects of monetary and fiscal policies on economics health Effects of, and process for, determining interest rates Causes for some economies growing faster than other economies Uses GDP (Gross Domestic Product: monetary value of all finished goods and services within a give time period) and goods and services by their market price Inflation, unemployment rate, GDP Scarcity We have unlimited wants and limited resources to satisfy those wwants There is a scarcity of resources Resources have alternative uses Basic Economic Problem (BEP) BEP is every and affects us all Due to the problem of “relative scarcity” Scarcity relative to our wants Resources may be abundant but wants are unlimited, how are the resources allocated: relative scarcity Due to scarcity, we are forced to make choices Resources cannot be used for all human wants We must choose We have unlimited wants, but there is a scarcity of resources to satisfy those wants.</description></item><item><title>Literature Notes</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Literature/Literature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Literature/Literature/</guid><description>THESE NOTES ARE IN ORDER OF THE CONTENT COVERED, WITH INITIAL CONTENT AT THE TOP, AND FINAL CONTENT AT THE BOTTOM!</description></item><item><title>Market Efficiency</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Economics/MarketEfficiency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Economics/MarketEfficiency/</guid><description>Go back

Ego-centric point of view Context Romanticism: attitude or intellectual orientation that characterised many works of literature, paintings, music, architecture and criticism in Western civilisation over a period from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century Can be seen as a rejection of the precepts of order, calm, harmony, balance, idealisation, and rationality that typified late 18th century Neo-classicism in particular Also a reaction against the Enlightenment and against 18th Century The Romantic Movement Freedom of the individual Rejection of restricting social conventions and political rule Fight for rights of the common man Emphasis on emotions and the imagination over reason and logic Free spontaneous action over controlled calculated behaviour Valorisation of the wilderness The “noble savage” Savage meaning people from other, non-Euro places Revival of interest on folklore and legends Chivalry As an aesthetic philosophy, Romanticism engages with these key concepts:</description></item><item><title>Scalars and Vectors</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Physics/ScaVec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/year-11-notes/Physics/ScaVec/</guid><description>go back
