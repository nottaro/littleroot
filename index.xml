John Dalton 1803-08: Proposed “Atomic Theory of Matter“
Matter (elements) is composed of small, indivisible, particles called “atoms” All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties) Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds Atom is a sphere Disadvantages</description></item><item><title>Chemistry Notes</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/Subjects/Chemistry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/Subjects/Chemistry/</guid><description>THESE NOTES ARE IN ORDER OF THE CONTENT COVERED, WITH INITIAL CONTENT AT THE TOP, AND FINAL CONTENT AT THE BOTTOM!</description></item><item><title>Covalent Bonding</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/covalent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/covalent/</guid><description> go back

Ego-centric point of view Context Romanticism: attitude or intellectual orientation that characterised many works of literature, paintings, music, architecture and criticism in Western civilisation over a period from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century Can be seen as a rejection of the precepts of order, calm, harmony, balance, idealisation, and rationality that typified late 18th century Neo-classicism in particular Also a reaction against the Enlightenment and against 18th Century The Romantic Movement Freedom of the individual Rejection of restricting social conventions and political rule Fight for rights of the common man Emphasis on emotions and the imagination over reason and logic Free spontaneous action over controlled calculated behaviour Valorisation of the wilderness The “noble savage” Savage meaning people from other, non-Euro places Revival of interest on folklore and legends Chivalry As an aesthetic philosophy, Romanticism engages with these key concepts:</description></item><item><title>Scalars and Vectors</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/ScaVec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/ScaVec/</guid><description>go back
