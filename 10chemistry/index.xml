Coal and Crude Oil Formation Fractional Distillation A method of separating fractions of crude oil Crude oil: all unprocessed oil, a mixture of hydrocarbons with different chain lengths Fractions: a group of hydrocarbons with a similar length chain The longer the molecule, the greater the intermolecular forces, therefore the greater amount of energy required to break the bonds Crude oil fractions Refined gas Petrol Naphtha Wax Bitumen Steps Crude oil is heated in a furnace The heated crude oil, mostly in a vapour state, is pumped into the column and travels very fast due to its energy The column has a heat gradient, and decreases in temperature going up, with the very bottom being very hot The constituents that have higher boiling points will collect at lower points and condense, while substances with lower boiling points will rise higher and condense at higher points due to the higher areas being cooler (increasing boiling points) Gas Petrol Naphtha Kerosene Diesel Bitumen Shorter chain molecules have lower boiling points and will therefore reach the higher area The condensations are collected</description></item><item><title>Definitions</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Chemistry/Definitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Chemistry/Definitions/</guid><description>go back
Viscosity: thickness of fluid, how resistant a fluid is to movement through it Volatility: a measure of how readily a substance vaporises or transitions from a liquid phase to a gas phase Melting point: temperature at which matter changes from solid to liquid form Boiling point: temperature at which matter changes from liquid to gas form Fossil: preserved remains or traces of a living thing Fossil fuel: Substances that were formed from decaying animal and plant matter being submitted to high temperatures and pressure over millions of years.</description></item><item><title>Energy</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Chemistry/Energy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Chemistry/Energy/</guid><description>go back

Hydrocarbons Functional Groups and Homologous Series Functional group: atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule Homologous series is a group of molecules with the same functional group but a different number of -CH2 groups Family that differs by number of carbon atoms Functional groups determine the pattern of reactivity of a homologous series, whereas the carbon chain length determines physical properties such as melting/boiling points Carbon Bonding capacity: 4 Can form 4 covalent bonds 4 valence electrons Sharing 1 electron forms a covalent bond Carbon can make double or triple covalent bonds Saturated Hydrocarbons Hydrocarbons with only single bonds between carbon atoms Simplest class of hydrocarbons Each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible Makes them relatively unreactive/un-volatile, apart from their interaction with the oxygen in the air in the case of combustion Structural Isomers Isomers: organic molecules with the same molecular formula but a different structural formula Structural isomers have: Different names Different shapes Different chemical properties Read from left to right for isomers Alkanes Family of hydrocarbons Saturated hydrocarbons with only single bonds between the carbon atoms Can be arranged in continuous straight chains or in branches or rings Hydrogen = 2 x carbon + 2 Naming Alkanes: Branched Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain.</description></item></channel></rss>
