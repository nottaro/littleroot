Differences in Discrete Energy Levels Key Points:
Unique Spectra: As the discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique to each atom, the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element.</description></item><item><title>Atomic Structure</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/AtomicStructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/AtomicStructure/</guid><description>Go Back
John Dalton 1803-08: Proposed “Atomic Theory of Matter“
Matter (elements) is composed of small, indivisible, particles called “atoms” All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties) Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds Atom is a sphere Disadvantages</description></item><item><title>Covalent Bonding</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/covalent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/covalent/</guid><description>go back
Electrostatic force of attraction between shared pair of electrons and the nuclei on either side Non-metal atoms involved Covalent bonding: Non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons by overlapping valence shells to give each a nobel gas structure A covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons There is a force of attraction between the bonding pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms at each side Hydrogen atoms only need 2 electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium Octet Rule: Atoms gain, lose or share eelectrons when they combine with other atoms to acquire a stable octet (8) of electrons There are exceptions: $SF_6$ and $BCl_3$ Properties Non-conductors of electricity Electrons are localised in the electron cloud or as bonding pairs Therefore, they are immobile, and cannot conduct charge Bad conductors of heat No free particles that can move from one end of the particle to another, carrying kinetic energy (temperature) Thus, it is a bad conductor of heat Soft Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules and so these molecules can be easily separated and rearranged when a force is applied, making them soft Low melting/boiling point Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules Small amount of energy is need to overcome these bonds, and there is a low melting/boiling point These increase with molecular size, which increases the strength of the bonds Note: These are for Covalent Molecular Structures, not Covalent Network Structures, which you do not need to know .</description></item><item><title>Electronic Configuration</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</guid><description>Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells

Forces between molecules Allotropes: Different physical forms of the same element E.g., carbon, diamond, graphite Gases: Very weak attraction between particles Liquid: stronger attraction between particles Solids: Very strong attraction between particles Also known as Van Der Waal&amp;rsquo;s forces Dispersion Forces Forces existing between 2 polar molecules Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 oppositely charged temporary/induced dipoles Electrons move randomly; thus dipoles are temporary, as their charges is based on these electrons, as their localisation is temporary Molecules with dipoles can polarise other molecules and make them form temporary dipoles - these are called induced dipoles This ESF of attraction between the temporary and induced dipoles are known as dispersion forces These are temporary, as electrons move randomly, therefore the dipoles form, break apart, and reform randomly Ion-dipole Forces Forces existing between an ion and a polar molecule Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between an ion and a dipole Note: &amp;ldquo;Intermolecular force&amp;rdquo; is a misnomer, as this is in ionic substances, not covalent substances Stronger than permanent dipole-dipole and dispersion forces Permanent Dipole-Dipole Forces present between 2 polar molecules Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 net dipoles; i.</description></item><item><title>Ionic Bonding</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/ionic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/ionic/</guid><description>go back

Relative Atomic Mass In this context: weighted average of all isotopes occurring naturally of an element, relative to $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a Carbon-12 atom in its ground state We use this when determining composition of elements from mass spectrometry Determined from mass spectrums Calculated as $$Ar(X)=\frac{(%a \times m(A))+(%b \times m(B))&amp;hellip;(%z \times m(Z))}{100}$$ Where $%a$ is percentage abundance of isotope A.</description></item><item><title>Metallic Bonding</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/metal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/metal/</guid><description>Electrostatic forces of attraction between cations of metal and a sea of delocalised electrons

Electronegativity is the ability of an atom in gaseous phase to attract electrons to itself Bond Polarity The property of shared pairs of electrons being closer to one atom than the other in a covalent bond results in an uneven distribution of electrical charge along the bond.</description></item><item><title>VSEPR - Valence Shell Electron Repulsion Theory</title><link>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/VSEPR/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/11Chemistry/VSEPR/</guid><description>go back
VSEPR model can predict the structure of most molecules and polyatomic ions in which the central atom is a non-metal Also works for some structures in which the central atom is a metal VSEPR builds on Lewis Electron Dot Structures Lewis structures alone predict only connectivity while the Lewis structure and VSEPR together can predict the geometry of each atom in a molecule Key Concepts The 4 pairs of electrons around a central atom repel each other Pairs of electrons arrange themselves so they are as far apart as possible The repulsion between lone pairs is greater than the repulsion between bonding Bent&amp;rsquo;s angle is 104.</description></item></channel></rss>
