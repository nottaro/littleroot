John Dalton 1803-08: Proposed “Atomic Theory of Matter“
Matter (elements) is composed of small, indivisible, particles called “atoms” All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties) Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds Atom is a sphere Disadvantages</description></item><item><title>Biofuels</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Chemistry/Biofuels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Chemistry/Biofuels/</guid><description> Biofuels: fuels made using living organisms or the wastes they produce This includes: Biogas: produced from the breakdown of organic material Ethanol: produced by the fermentation of sugar from plant material Unlike fossil fuels, biofuels provide a renewable source of energy They are also thought to have less of an impact on the environment than fossil fuels Biogas Biogas is a gas produced by the anaerobic fermentation of organic waste containing carbohydrates by bacteria Contains: 40%-70% methane Carbon dioxide Traces of hydrogen, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulphide Biogas is currently used in several ways, including in the production of electricity, heating water for central heating systems, and as fuel for buses The production of biogas can be ideal in remote areas lacking mains electricity or sewage systems It not only produces a useful fuel, but can also be used to get ride of large quantities of sewage or other organic waste material On a small scale, biogas digesters can be used to provide energy for individual families or farms In parts of rural India, cow dung is used to produce biogas for cooking Bioethanol Ethanol produced by the anaerobic fermentation of glucose by yeast is used to make fuels such as gasohol It is successfully used as a fuel for cars in Brazil and the USA Brazil produces ethanol from sugar cane, whereas the USA uses maize (corn) $$C_6 H_{12}O_6 \rightarrow 2C_2H_6O + 2CO_2$$ Ethanol is produced by carrying out the following steps Glucose is obtained from either: Maize starch broken down into glucose by the action of carbohydrase enzymes Sugar cane juices Yeast are added to the glucose, they respire anaerobically, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide Once fermentation is complete, pure ethanol is obtained by distilling the mixture Back to Biofuels: SAVE THE PLANET - Ms Pilling Biofuels are thought to produce lower greenhouse gas emissions and particulates than conventional transport fuels Biomass is a renewable source of energy, thus biofuels are a more sustainable form of energy as it will not run out Using biofuels instead of fossil fuels can also help to conserve the world&amp;rsquo;s non-renewable fuel resources Biofuels can also be cheaper to use for drivers, as governments often introduce schemes to encourage people to reduce their emissions Carbon neutral: no net release of carbon dioxide Biofuels are not completely carbon neutral because energy is used in the production and transportation of the biofuel This energy is often provided by fossil fuels There are also concerns that the</description></item><item><title>Chromatography</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Chemistry/Chromatography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Chemistry/Chromatography/</guid><description>go back

Electrostatic force of attraction between shared pair of electrons and the nuclei on either side Non-metal atoms involved Covalent bonding: Non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons by overlapping valence shells to give each a nobel gas structure A covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons There is a force of attraction between the bonding pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms at each side Hydrogen atoms only need 2 electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium Octet Rule: Atoms gain, lose or share eelectrons when they combine with other atoms to acquire a stable octet (8) of electrons There are exceptions: $SF_6$ and $BCl_3$ Properties Non-conductors of electricity Electrons are localised in the electron cloud or as bonding pairs Therefore, they are immobile, and cannot conduct charge Bad conductors of heat No free particles that can move from one end of the particle to another, carrying kinetic energy (temperature) Thus, it is a bad conductor of heat Soft Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules and so these molecules can be easily separated and rearranged when a force is applied, making them soft Low melting/boiling point Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules Small amount of energy is need to overcome these bonds, and there is a low melting/boiling point These increase with molecular size, which increases the strength of the bonds Note: These are for Covalent Molecular Structures, not Covalent Network Structures, which you do not need to know .</description></item><item><title>Electronic Configuration</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Chemistry/ElectronicConfig/</guid><description>go back
