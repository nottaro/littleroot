It hasn’t been two weeks, but little Timmy’s already beaten the game using the totally awesome Charizard he got from Professor Oak. Little Timmy thinks he’s hot shit. Little Timmy is a spoiled brat because his pushover parents let him play video games for ten hours a day. \n\u003e \n\u003e And little Timmy is brimming with the naive confidence of an infant sloshing around in a loaded diaper.

It knows Fire Spin, Flamethrower, AND Fire Blast.  \n\u003e \n\u003e “Daaaamn, Timwad,” says Kyle moments later through a mouthful of Gushers and Pepsi Blue, having 6-0’ed Timmy’s entire team with a single Golduck. “You’re so bad at this game.

Then consumers use the petrol to power the car\n-   Burning coal to spin turbines to generate electricity to charge a laptop. Consumers use the energy stored in the laptop\n-   Truck bringing of diesel to transport eggs to consumers\n\n## Greenhouse Effect\n- Complete combustion: reacts with air to produce carbon dioxide and water\n- Incomplete combustion: reacts with air to produce carbon monoxide and water, or carbon and water\n\nWith the burning of fossil fuels, we put a lot of carbon dioxide into the air. \n\nCause + Effect enhanced\n1.  Extra burning of fossil fuels\n2.  Enhanced greenhouse effect\n3.  Average global temperatures rise\n4.  Ice melting and sea level rises\n\n![](11SubjectImages/The%20Greenhouse%20Effect.png)\n\n![](11SubjectImages/Earth's%20surface.png)\n- Some sunlight is absorbed by greenhouse gases. However, the kinetic energy formed by the greenhouse gasses moving and the absorbed sunlight, heats up the earth\n\n## Coal and Crude Oil Formation\n\n![](11SubjectImages/Crude%20Oil%20Formation.png)\n![](11SubjectImages/Coal%20Formation.png)\n\n## Fractional Distillation\n- A method of separating fractions of crude oil\n\t- Crude oil: all unprocessed oil, a mixture of hydrocarbons with different chain lengths\n\t-  Fractions: a group of hydrocarbons with a similar length chain\n- The longer the molecule, the greater the intermolecular forces, therefore the greater amount of energy required to break the bonds\n- **Crude oil fractions**\n\t-   Refined gas\n\t-   Petrol\n\t-   Naphtha\n\t-   Wax\n\t-   Bitumen\n\n### Steps\n1.  **Crude oil is heated in a furnace**\n2.  **The heated crude oil, mostly in a vapour state, is pumped into the column and travels very fast due to its energy**\n3.  **The column has a heat gradient, and decreases in temperature going up, with the very bottom being very hot**\n4.  **The constituents that have higher boiling points will collect at lower points and condense, while substances with lower boiling points will rise higher and condense at higher points due to the higher areas being cooler (increasing boiling points)**\n\t1.  **Gas**\n\t2.  **Petrol**\n\t3.  **Naphtha**\n\t4.  **Kerosene**\n\t5.  **Diesel**\n\t6.  **Bitumen**\n5.  **Shorter chain molecules have lower boiling points and will therefore reach the higher area**\n6.  **The condensations are collected**\n\n## Hydrocarbons\n\n### **Functional Groups and Homologous Series**\n-   Functional group: atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule\n-   Homologous series is a group of molecules with the same functional group but a different number of -CH2 groups\n-   Family that differs by number of carbon atoms\n-   Functional groups determine the pattern of reactivity of a homologous series, whereas the carbon chain length determines physical properties such as melting/boiling points\n\n## **Carbon**\n-   Bonding capacity: 4\n-   Can form 4 covalent bonds\n-   4 valence electrons\n-   Sharing 1 electron forms a covalent bond\n-   Carbon can make double or triple covalent bonds\n\n## **Saturated Hydrocarbons**\n-   Hydrocarbons with only single bonds between carbon atoms\n-   Simplest class of hydrocarbons\n-   Each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible\n-   Makes them relatively unreactive/un-volatile, apart from their interaction with the oxygen in the air in the case of combustion\n  \n## **Structural Isomers**\n-   Isomers: organic molecules with the same molecular formula but a different structural formula\n-   Structural isomers have:\n\t-   Different names\n\t-   Different shapes\n\t-   Different chemical properties\n-   Read from left to right for isomers\n\n## **Alkanes**\n-   Family of hydrocarbons\n-   Saturated hydrocarbons with only single bonds between the carbon atoms\n-   Can be arranged in continuous straight chains or in branches or rings\n-   Hydrogen = 2 x carbon + 2\n\n\n### **Naming Alkanes: Branched**\n\n1.  Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule\n2.  Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain. Start at the end that will give the smallest numbers possible to the carbon atoms where the branches originate\n3.  Substituents = atoms attached to the parent chain. **Alkyl group:** A substituent that is a hydrocarbon. The names of alkyl groups use the same prefixes as the alkanes, but with a -yl suffix, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. Substituents are named by placing the carbon number from the parent carbon chain in front of the name with the substituent. \n4.  Use a prefix to indicate the appearance of more than one of the same substituent in the structural formula. 2 of the same group is di-, 3 is tri-, 4 is tetra\n5.  Multiple different substituents are listed in alphabetical order. Ignore any of the prefixes from rule 4.\n6.  Commas are used to separate multiple numbers. Hyphens come between the number and name of a substituent. The parent name comes immediately after the last substituent. There are no spaces in the name\n\n### **Melting and boiling points: Alkanes**\n-   Alkanes have low melting or boiling points\n-   Due to very weak intermolecular forces between alkane molecules\n-   Methane, ethane and butane are gases at room temperature\n-   As the carbon chain gets longer, because the attraction between the molecules increases, therefore more energy is needed to overcome the attraction \n-   Branched isomers have lower boiling/melting points, because the branches prevent the molecules from getting close so they cannot attract to each other as strongly\n\n### **Van der Waal’s forces**\n-   Named after Dutch scientist J D Van der Waal who discovered them\n-   The forces are created by the constant movements of electrons in atoms of molecules at high speeds\n-   At any instant in time there is the likelihood that one side of the molecule has a greater proportion of electrons\n-   This is called a dipole, and causes the molecule to have positively and negatively charged ends\n-   A temporary dipole or imbalance of charge can attract the electron cloud from a neighbouring atom or molecule, e.g. slightly positive end attracts negatively charged electrons\n-   The temporary dipole induces an imbalance of charges in neighbouring molecules\n-   The strength of the VdW force is dependent on the size of the molecules or atoms\n-   As the size and molecular mass of the molecule increases so does the number of electrons, resulting in a greater imbalance of charge, and therefore a greater VdW attraction\n-   This is why boiling points increase as the number of carbon atoms increase in alkanes, more energy is required to overcome the VdW forces\n\n### **Viscosity of Alkanes**\n-   Methane, ethane, propane, butane = gases at room temperature\n-   Alkanes from pentane through to C16 are liquids\n-   The viscosity of liquid alkanes increases as the number of carbon atoms increase\n-   The increase in viscosity is due to the increase of intermolecular forces between molecules of increasing size\n\n### **Volatility of Alkanes**\n-   High volatility: low boiling point\n-   High volatility: weak intermolecular forces, thus fewer number of carbons in straight chain the higher the volatility\n\n### **Chemical Properties of Alkanes**\n-   Combustion\n\t-   Alkanes are flammable\n\t-   Complete combustion (lots of oxygen present) produces carbon dioxide and water\n\t-   Incomplete combustion (limited oxygen present) produces carbon monoxide and water\n\n## **Alkenes**\n-   Alkenes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one double bond between 2 carbon atoms\n-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons\n-   C=C double bond\n-   The double bond is the functional group of the alkene homologous series\n-   **Hydrogen = 2*carbon**\n\n### **Naming Alkenes: Straight Chain** \n-   Alkenes with carbon atoms arranged in a continuous straight line\n-   Retain the prefixes **Eth, Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct** for the parent compound\n-   Parent chain is the long chain containing the C=C\n-   Number the chain from the end that gives the C=C the lowest number\n-   Family suffix name: ene\n\n### **Naming Alkenes: Structural Isomerism**\n-   Alkenes containing 4+ carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, structural isomerism occurs\n-   e.g. C4 alkene C4H8 has 2 isomers\n-   Use the lower number of C where the double bond occurs for suffix n-ene\n-   The prefixes are still the same for alkanes  \n\n1.  Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule with the C=C, this is given the stem name n-ene\n2.  Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain that will give the C=C the lowest number\n3.  Name the side chains in the same way as with alkanes\n\n### **Geometrical Structural Isomers**\n\n-   There is no rotation possible around a double bond\n-   2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different\n-   Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond\n-   Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond\n\n## **Properties of Alkenes**\n-   Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the relatively instability of the double bond\n-   Breaking a carbon-carbon bond from a double bond between carbon atoms requires less energy than breaking a C-C bond\n-   The boiling and melting points of alkenes are generally slightly lower than alkanes with the same amounts of carbon atoms.\n-   The boiling point of straight-chain alkenes is more than branched-chain alkenes just as in alkanes\n-   Alkenes with 2-4 carbon atoms = gases at room temperature\n-   Alkenes with 5-17 carbon atoms = liquids at room temperature\n-   Viscosity of alkenes increases with increased carbon chain length\n-   Volatility of alkenes decreases with increased carbon chain length\n\n## **Alkynes**\n-   Alkynes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one triple bond between 2 carbon atoms\n-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons\n-   C☰C triple bond\n-   The triple bond is the functional group of the alkyne homologous series’\n-   Hydrogen = 2*carbon - 2\n\n### **Naming Alkynes: Straight chain**\n-   Alkynes with carbon atoms arranged in a continuous straight line\n-   Retain the prefixes **Eth, Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct** for the parent compound\n-   Parent compound is the longest chain containing the C☰C\n-   Number the chain from the end that gives the C☰C the lowest number\n-   Family name suffix: yne\n\n### **Properties of Alkynes**\n-   Ethyne, propyne and butyne = gases, C5-C12 = liquid\n-   Boiling points\n\t-   Compared to alkanes and alkenes, alkynes have a slightly higher boiling point\n-   Viscosity of alkynes increases with increased carbon chain length\n-   Volatility of alkynes decreases with increased carbon chain length\n\n## **Cycloalkanes**\n-   Rings of carbon atoms with distinguishing chemical properties = cycloalkanes\n-   Cycloalkanes only contain carbon-hydrogen bonds and carbon-carbon single bonds, but in cycloalkanes, the carbon atoms are joined in a ring\n-   The smallest cycloalkane is cyclopropane\n-   Hydrogen = 2*carbon\n\n### **Naming Cycloalkanes**\n-   Use the number of carbons in the ring to determine the prefix **Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct**\n-   Suffix = n-ane\n-   Place cyclo- in front\n\n## **Cycloalkenes**\n-   Hydrogen = 2*(carbon - number of double bonds)\n\n## **Naming Cycloalkenes**\n-   Use the number of carbons in the ring to determine the prefix **Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct**\n-   Suffix = ene \n-   Place cyclo- in front\n\n## **Alcohols**\n-   Homologous group of carbon compounds containing the hydroxyl (-OH) group\n-   Methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc\n-   General formula Cn, H2n+1, OH\n\n# **Combustion**\n- Combustion: substance burns in the presence of oxygen\n\t-   Reaction between a substance and oxygen that releases heat and light energy\n- Fuel: substance that reacts with oxygen (combusts) to produce useful energy\n- Many fractions obtained from crude oil are used as fuels because they contain hydrocarbons that burn easily and release a large amount of useful energy\n- Complete combustion: lots of oxygen present\n\t-   Hydrocarbon + oxygen —\u003e Carbon dioxide + water + energy\n- If there is a shortage of air(oxygen), incomplete combustion takes place\n- Incomplete combustion: limited oxygen present\n\t-   Hydrocarbon + oxygen —\u003e Carbon dioxide + water + energy\n\t-   Still yields carbon dioxide and water\n\t-   However, it produces toxic by-products, in CO and C\n\t-   Also releases less energy than complete oxygen\n\t-   Carbon monoxide is poisonous because it reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen, and reduces the ability of blood to expel carbon dioxide\n\n### **Balancing equations: Combustion**\n1.  Balance C\n2.  Balance H\n3.  If oxygen is an odd number, times everything by 2\n\nHeat of combustion is used to refer to the amount of heat released during a combustion reaction\n-   Involves combustion of a measured mass of alcohol to heat a measured mass of water over a measured temperature rise\n-   It is assumed that the total heat released by the combustion reaction will be absorbed by the water\n\nThe heat of combustion can be calculated with:$$\\Delta H=mc \\Delta t$$\n-   ∆H: change in enthalpy (j)\n-   m: mass of heated substance (g)\n-   c: specific heat capacity of heated substance (˚C)\n-   ∆T: change in temperature of heated substance\n\n# **Isomers**\n- Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula (i.e. same number and type of atoms) but in which the atoms are arranged in a different way\n- There are 2 main categories of isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism\n\n### **Structural Isomerisms**\n-   Different structural formulae\n-   Chain isomerism\n-   Carbon chain is arranged differently, e.g. different shape, L shape instead of chain, cross shape\n-   Positional isomerism\n-   Functional group is attached to a different carbon atom, e.g. 3-chloropentane, 2-chloropentane\n-   Also exists in alkenes with 4 or more carbon atoms\n-   Functional group isomerism\n-   Have different functional groups, so are members of different homologous series\n\n### **Stereoisomerism**\n-   Have same structural formula\n-   3d arrangement of atoms is different\n-   2 types\n-   Cis-trans isomerism\n-   Optical isomerism\n\n\t### **Cis-trans isomerism**\n\t-   Molecules can rotate freely around C-C covalent bonds, but not around C=C double bonds\n\t-   Leads to cis-trans isomerism, in which isomers differ in the arrangement of the groups attached to the carbons in the double bonds\n\t-   These isomers cannot be super imposed on each other because the arrangement of the methyl groups is different\n\t-   If an alkyl group or atom other than hydrogen is attached to each carbon then the atoms can be named either **cis** (on the same side) or **trans** (on the opposite side)\n\t\n\t**Limitations of Cis-Trans isomerism**\n\t-   In more complex organic compounds, in which multiple hydrogens have been substituted by different groups, isomers cannot be defined using the **cis-trans** notation\n\t-   Instead, a different system is used for these type of molecules: **E-Z notation**\n\n### **E-Z Notation**\n-   Used to identify stereoisomers that cannot be called cis or trans\n-   Isomers are identified as either E or Z depending on what “priority” is given to the groups attached to the carbon atoms in the double bond\n-   Priority of these groups is determined by a series of complex rules\n-   **E** represents the German word “entgegen” and corresponds to trans isomers\n-   The highest priority groups are on the opposite side of the double bond\n-   **Z** represents the German word “zusammen” and corresponds to cis isomers\n-   The highest priority groups are on the same side of the double bond\n\n### **Optical isomerism**\n-   A molecule can exist as 2 isomers that are non-superimposable, mirror images of each other, just like a left hand and right hand\n-   Optical isomers have the same physical properties but they rotate polarised light in opposite directions\n\n# **Energy in Chemical Change**\n\n## **Understanding Energy**\n-   Energy: capacity to do work\n-   Measured in Joules\n-   Can be transferred or transformed\n-   Can therefore come in different forms\n\t-   Potential energy\n\t-   Chemical energy\n\t-   Nuclear energy\n\t-   Mechanical energy\n\t-   Elastic energy\n\t-   Gravitational energy\n\t-   Kinetic energy\n\t-   Heat energy\n\t-   Light energy\n\t-   Electrical energy\n\t-   Sound energy\n-   Enthalpy: changes taking place in a chemical reaction\n-   Total energy present in a reaction\n-   △H = H(products) - H(reactants)\n-   H: enthalpy\n-   △H: change in enthalpy\n\n**2 prefixes: system and surroundings**\n\n**System**: the area in which the chemical reaction happens\n\n**Surroundings**: Contents outside the system that energy is transferred to/from\n\n**2 types of reactions**\n\nExothermic reactions: transfers energy from system to surroundings\n-   Energy is released\n-   Bonds are broken\n-   Heat is transferred/released from system to surroundings\n\nEndothermic reactions: transfers energy from surroundings to system\n-   Heat is transferred/absorbed from surroundings to system\n\nEnergy is stored in chemical bonds, known as chemical potential energy, or bond energy\n\nExothermic reactions have a negative value for △H, meaning enthalpy has decreased for the duration of the reaction\n-   Happens if chemical potential energy is converted to particle kinetic energy, e.g. increase in temperature\n-   Overall chemical potential energy is conserved in the form of heat\n-   However, this raises the system’s temperature, so heat flows away from the system to the surroundings\n-   The loss of heat energy from the system to the surroundings means that enthalpy has decreased\n\nEndothermic reactions have a positive value for △H, meaning enthalpy has increased for the duration of the reaction \n-   Particle kinetic energy is converted to chemical potential energy\n-   Reduction of particle kinetic energy means reacting system’s temperature will fall\n-   Heat flows from the surroundings to the system, increasing enthalpy\n\n## **Representing Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions**\n-   Enthalpy change can be shown graphically using an energy profile graph, or it can be written along with the equation \n-   Sometimes the heat absorbed or released during the reaction is written into the equation, rather than giving the enthalpy change\n![](11SubjectImages/Exothermic.png)\n![](11SubjectImages/Activation%20energy.png)\n![](11SubjectImages/Exothermic%20reaction.png)\n- When a catalyst is used, less energy is needed for a reaction to occur\n- Activation energy: amount of energy required to start/sustain reaction\n- catalyst: substance that lowers activation energy of the reaction, and is not consumed during the reaction\n\n# Definitions\n**Viscosity**: thickness of fluid, how resistant a fluid is to movement through it\n**Volatility**: a measure of how readily a substance vaporises or transitions from a liquid phase to a gas phase\n**Melting point:** temperature at which matter changes from solid to liquid form\n**Boiling point:** temperature at which matter changes from liquid to gas form\n**Fossil**: preserved remains or traces of a living thing\n**Fossil fuel**: Substances that were formed from decaying animal and plant matter being submitted to high temperatures and pressure over millions of years. Rich deposits of hydrocarbon mixtures that formed from the remains of organisms\n**Energy**: The ability to do work\n**Direct energy consumption**: Energy we use, e.g. burning of fossil fuels for our car. Energy that people consume through their own activities. Includes lighting, heat, and fuel for transport\n**Indirect energy consumption**: Energy cost of an item associated with production. Includes electricity and energy used to grow food, manufacturing, etc\n**Organic chemistry:** Study of carbon and carbon based compounds. This excludes metallic carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, and oxides of carbon.\n**Organic compound**: a carbon based compound. Carbon always forms **4 covalent bonds**\n**Hydrocarbon**: a compound that contains only carbon and hydrogen. Crude oil contains naturally occurring hydrocarbons\n**Crude oil**: a complex mixture of hydrocarbons formed by geological action on decayed aquatic plant and animal matter over millions of years. Hydrocarbons are separated from others through fractional distillation\n**Fractional distillation**: the first step in oil refinement. Since boiling points of molecules increase as molecule’s mass increases, separation is roughly in order of increasing numbers of carbon atoms per molecule. The crude oil mixture is heated, fractions turn into vapour, rise, condense, and the liquid is collected. Usually the fraction is still a mixture and requires further refining","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Chemistry/AtomicSpectra":{"title":"Atomic Spectra","content":"\n[Go Back](Subjects/Chemistry.md)\n\n\n\n# _**Differences in Discrete Energy Levels**_\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1.  **Unique Spectra**: As the discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique to each atom, the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element.\n2.  Therefore, each element has different and unique emission and absorption spectra as the range of frequencies of light emitted are based on this unique set of discrete energy level differences\n\n# **Atomic Emission Spectra: used to identify elements in mixtures of high concentration**\n\n1.  The substance is vaporised, and put into a discharge tube\n2.  An electric discharge is passed through the tube. Electrons in the discharge excite other electrons by transferring kinetic energy during collision, then deflecting and losing energy\n3.  The electrons are **excited to a higher energy state** (as it has experienced an increase in energy exactly equal to E2 - E1)\n4.  Since they are unstable in their excited state, they will **transition** down to their **ground state**, and release energy in the form of radiation that has energy exactly equal to E2 - E1\n5.  Since **multiple transitions can occur within an atom**, a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength each is produced; thus when these emissions are captured an analysed in a line spectrometer; we only see specific light present\n6.  This produces a single stream of radiation, as all the wavelengths are travelling in the same direction. When the radiation is passed through a prism, the different frequencies/wavelengths are **separated** from each other, and are projected onto a black spectrum\n7.  It takes the form of coloured lines on a black background\n8.  Because all elements have a **unique spectra**, we can identify the element based on this\n\n# **Atomic Absorption Spectra: used to identify absorption of elements, or ability to retain heat**\n\n1.  White light (light of all frequencies) is passed through a substance in cool gas form\n2.  The substance’s electrons absorb the photons that are equal to their difference in energy levels and become **excited** (increase in energy exactly equal to E2-E1)\n3.  The electrons then transition back down to their **ground state**, as they are unstable in their normal state\n4.  However, the energy emitted (equal to E2-E1) d**oes not travel parallel** to its original direction. Therefore, they will not reach the spectroscope, and are **missing** from the spectrum when the light is separated\n5.  It takes the forms of black lines on the colour spectrum\n6.  Because all elements have a **unique spectra**, we can identify the element based on this\n\n# **Flame Test: used to detect primary metal ions**\n\n1.  Sample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame\n2.  As the substance is heated, its **electrons become excited**, as they gain energy, and transition to a higher energy state\n3.  The electrons are unstable in this state, so they quickly transition to their ground state. When this happens, it emits photons with energy equal to the difference in energy levels which correspond to specific wavelengths\n4.  Therefore, the **photons have specific wavelength**s. Higher energies mean smaller wavelengths, and vice versa. **Specific wavelengths** mean **specific colours** are **observed**\n5.  Since excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of different photons of different wavelengths can be emitted. Therefore, a **spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed**\n6.  As most non-metals emit EMR outside the visible spectrum, we cannot use the flame test to identify non-metal atoms present. Most metals produce some EMR in the visible spectrum that can be used to identify them\n\n**What can it be used for?**\n\n1.  Ionic salts: we can only use the flame test for simple ionic solids and metals because when heated, the metal ions and the anions separate and the metal ion produces emission that is within the visible spectrum\n\n**What can’t it be used for?**\n\n1.  Complex molecules:\n    1.  These molecules have a large number of energy levels that can overlap to produce new energy levels, and so, excitation and de-excitation within these molecules produce a large variety of EMR and so their emission is not characteristic\n    2.  Large majority produce EMR that is outside the visible spectrum, so it cannot be observed\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n1.  The salt’s metal cation may not be excited by the relatively low temperature of the flame, e.g., magnesium\n2.  Salt may not be completely excited, meaning only a part of the emission spectra is emitted, leading to a different colour being observed\n3.  If the material is a non-metal (e.g. ionic compound), it may not be (fully?) excited at low temperatures or may produce EMR outside the visible spectrum\n4.  Ethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour (orange flame)\n5.  Some elements have (very?) similar colours; this makes it difficult to distinguish between 2 different elements","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Chemistry/AtomicStructure":{"title":"Atomic Structure","content":"\n[Go Back](Subjects/Chemistry.md)\n\n# **John Dalton**\n\n**1803-08: Proposed “Atomic Theory of Matter“**\n\n1.  Matter (elements) is composed of small, **indivisible**, particles called “atoms”\n2.  All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties)\n3.  Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms\n4.  Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds\n5.  Atom is a sphere\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n1.  Atoms **are divisible**: they are made of smaller particles known as **subatomic particles**\n    \n2.  Not all atoms for a given element are identical: some elements have atoms that **differ** in **mass** and **density (different number of neutrons)**. These are known as **isotopes**.\n    \n3.  Dalton claimed that atoms for different elements are different in all respects: Proved wrong in certain cases: Argon and Calcium both have an AMU of 40: known as **isobars**\n    \n4.  Dalton also claimed that different elements combined in whole-number ratios to form compounds. Not observed in complex compounds, e.g. sugar (CHO )\n    \n    12\n    \n    22\n    \n    11\n    \n5.  This theory fails to explain the existence of allotropes: it does not account for differences in properties of charcoal, graphite, diamond\n    \n\n# **J.J. Thompson**\n\n## **1903: Discovered Electron, and proposed Plum Pudding Model**\n\n### **Cathode Ray Experiment**\n\n1.  A **high voltage** causes electrons to be discharged from the cathode to the anode. J.J. Thompson discovered the same cathode ray for all metals, i.e. same cathode ray was emitted regardless of material. He also discovered that metals exposed to cathode rays would become charged\n2.  Cathode rays were passed through an **electric** and **magnetic field**\n3.  First, it was passed through an **electric field only**. The cathode rays were noted to be deflected towards the **positive** side of the electric field\n4.  Then, it was passed through **both** an **electric field** and a **magnetic field** applied **alongside** the electric field. The cathode rays passed **straight through**\n5.  Thus, the cathode rays were affected by both an electric and magnetic field\n6.  Since he knew the magnitude of the fields, using physics, Thompson determined the mass of the particle to be 1/1000 AMU\n7.  Since light is not affected by charge/electrical fields, and the cathode rays deviated towards the positive plate, and all metals produced the same cathode ray:\n8.  Thompson stated that a cathode ray was a **beam of** **negatively charged particles with mass**, that was present in all matter(i.e. atom)\n\n### **Plum Pudding Model: Proposed due to findings of Cathode Ray Experiment**\n\n1.  Thompson knew that atoms were electrically neutral **and** contained particles of negative charge: therefore, they must contain equal amounts of positive charge\n2.  Therefore, Thompson suggested that an atom comprised of electrons spread within a region of uniform mass and charge\n3.  **Negative** particles **inside** a **positively-charged** sphere\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n1.  It is known that this is incorrect; electrons occupy fixed orbitals, and the positive charge is concentrated in the nucleus as protons\n2.  **Could not explain** the **findings** made by Ernest Rutherford’s **Gold Foil Experiment**\n\n# **Ernest Rutherford**\n\n## **1911: Discovered nucleus, protons, and that most of an atom is empty space**\n\n### **Gold Foil Experiment**\n\n1.  A lead block containing radioactive alpha emitters was used: this produced **alpha particles** that were targeted at a **zinc sulphide** screen\n2.  These alpha particles were directed to a very thin sheet of **gold** (only a few atoms wide)\n3.  When the alpha particles collided with the **zinc sulphide** screen, **flashes of light** were produced and the **impact positions** could be viewed through a **microscope**\n\n**Observations**\n\n1.  Most of the alpha particles passed straight the gold foil\n    1.  **Contradicts** the **Plum Pudding Model**, if it was true, a wall of spheres of positive charge would be formed, and **alpha particles** would have been **repelled**\n    2.  Therefore, since **most** alpha particles passed through the **gold foil**, an atom must comprise of **mostly empty space**\n2.  Some alpha particles were deflected in a minor way\n    1.  **Contradicts** the **Plum Pudding Model**, as it states that the entire atom is neutral due to the equal distribution of positive and negative charge; there is **no neutral region**\n    2.  Therefore, the repulsion is due to an electrical repulsion and in the context of the atom: There must be a positively charged region. **Rutherford** called this the **proton**\n    3.  Finally, since only a small amount of alpha particles were deflected, the positive charge must be concentrated to a **small volume** at the centre of the atom: i.e., the **nucleus**\n3.  Some alpha particles were deflected quite significantly (1 in 20 000)\n    1.  A significant deflection like this occurs only when there is a direct collision of 2 heavy charged particles; therefore, this deflection must be due to a direct collision with the positive region; this **reconfirmed** that the protons must be concentrated at the centre of the atom, i.e., the nucleus\n    2.  Therefore, deflection only occurs if the nuclear region has a **positive charge** and so the electrons must exist **separate** to the **protons** - Rutherford stated that the electrons must be orbiting **around** the nucleus\n\n### **Rutherford Model**\n\n1.  The atom comprises of mostly empty space occupied by very low mass negatively charged particles called electrons\n2.  The electrons orbit a very small (0.05% by volume) central region called the nucleus which is comprised of subatomic particles called protons\n3.  Protons are subatomic particles concentrated at the nucleus that comprise of the **majority** of an atom’s mass and a **positive charge**\n\n**Problems with the Rutherford Model**\n\n1.  It could not explain the stability of an atom because it doesn’t obey Maxwell’s law of electrodynamics\n    1.  An electron (an accelerating charge) should continuously emit radiation and gradually lose energy, so its distance from the nucleus should become shorter and finally fall into the nucleus. However, this never happens\n2.  The arrangement of electrons is not described at all\n3.  It cannot explain the atomic line-emission spectra\n4.  It does not have neutrons in its model\n\n# **Niels Bohr**\n\n## **Explained the orbitals of electrons, and the line emission spectra: 1913**\n\n**Context**\n\n1.  Scientists found that when an electric discharge is passed through a discharge tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, it emits some light\n2.  When this light is passed through a prism, it splits up into a set of 5 lines. This spectrum is called the line spectrum of hydrogen. This is known as the **line emission spectrum**. Scientists were unable to explain this\n\n### **Bohr’s Model: The Three Postulates**\n\n1.  **Fixed orbitals**: Electrons move in a circular orbit around the nucleus under the influence of the electrostatic attraction of the nucleus\n2.  **Angular momentum is quantised**\n    1.  Electrons occupy fixed energy levels and for these fixed energy levels electrons do not emit radiation as these orbits are stable (hence Maxwell’s Law)\n    2.  Energy levels are a specific distance from the centre of the nucleus, proportional to their energies\n3.  **Energy transitions**: Electrons can transition to higher or lower energy levels by emitting or absorbing fixed quantities of energy (photons)\n    1.  An electron can transition to a higher state by absorbing a photon with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n    2.  An electron can transition to a lower state by emitting a photon with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (initial and final)\n\n### **What Bohr’s Model tells us**\n\n1.  **Emission spectra**\n    1.  When an **electric discharge** is passed through a discharge tube, electrons that are found in that discharge transfer some kinetic energy during collision to the atoms’ electrons\n    2.  The electron issued the atom is then **excited to a higher energy state**(as it has experienced an increase in energy exactly equal to E2 - E1) and the incident electron will decelerate and be deflected in another direction\n    3.  As electrons are **unstable** in the **higher transition state**, they will **transition down** to the **ground state**, thus releasing energy in the form of **radiation** that has an energy exactly equal to E2-E1\n    4.  As the “frequency” of the radiation (and therefore its “colour”) is **proportional to the energy** it has, **one specific** wavelength/frequency of light will be produced per transition\n    5.  Since **multiple transitions can occur within an atom**, a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength each is produced; thus when these emissions are captured an analysed in a line spectrometer; we only see specific light present\n2.  **Unique Spectra**: As the discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique to each atom, the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element. Therefore, each element has different and unique emission and absorption spectra as the range of frequencies of light emitted are based on this unique set of discrete energy level differences\n\n**Problems with Bohr’s Model**\n\n1.  **Multi-electron Atoms**\n    1.  Does not work for atoms with more than 1 electron in the valence shell, and it is not possible to calculate all the spectral lines of all other atoms, as this model still has classical components, e.g., electrostatic attraction, whereas Schrodinger’s model is explains this, and is Q.E.D.\n2.  **Relative Intensities of Spectral Lines**\n    1.  The spectral lines are not of equal intensity, but Bohr’s model cannot explain why some electron transition would be favoured, and thus some wavelength of light appeared more intense in the spectra\n3.  **Hyperfine Lines**\n    1.  Careful observations showed that there were other known lines (hyperfine lines) i.e., 2 bands contained in a single band, thus the energy levels of Bohr’s model must be split but the model cannot account for this\n4.  **Zeeman effect**\n    1.  When a gas is excited in a magnetic field, the emission spectrum shows a splitting of the spectral lines (Zeeman effect) . The Bohr model cannot account for this\n\n# **Sir James Chadwick**\n\n## **Discovered the Neutron: 1932**\n\n1.  Sir Chadwick determined that protons made only 1/2 the mass of the atom when he analysed Rutherford’s experimental data; specifically the extent and frequency of alpha particle deflIection\n2.  Thus, he believed that there was a hidden component to the atom that constituted its remaining mass (50%)\n\n### **Experiment and Results**\n\n1.  In 1932 it was discovered that Beryllium, when bombarded by alpha particles, emitted a very energetic stream of radiation, originally thought to be gamma\n2.  However, further investigation into its properties revealed contradictory results. Like gamma rays, they were extremely penetrating, and since they were not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, neutral\n3.  Sir Chadwick fired alpha particles at beryllium which emitted an unknown radiation. This radiation was then allowed to incident at paraffin (proton rich) causing paraffin to release protons\n4.  Using the equation of linear momentum, Chadwick determined that the radiation was a particle of mass 1 AMU (similar to protons) but with 0 electrical charge. He called this the **neutron**","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Chemistry/Definitions":{"title":"Definitions","content":"\n![](11SubjectImages/ptable.jpg)\n\n**Orbitals**: Area of space that is likely to contain electrons\n\n**Cathode Ray Tube**: A high vacuum tube in which **cathode rays** produce luminous images on a fluorescent screen\n\n**Cathode Rays**: Another name for travelling electrons **Cathode**: Where electricity flows out.

produces higher resolution than light based imaging\n-   Most desired method for imaging\n\n### SEM - Scanning Electron Microscopy\n-   Uses electron beams to magnify infinitesimal features\n-   Electrons are deflected off object and then detected\n\n### STEM - Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy\n-   Atomic scale resolution, better than SEM\n-   Can cause sample damage\n\n### AFM - Atomic-force Microscopy\n-   3D characterisation of nanoparticles with sub-nanometre resolution\n-   Can directly create images of nanoparticles with dimensions between 0.5 to 50+ nano-metres\n\n\n## Safety of Nanoparticles:\n-   Nanoparticles can easily penetrate cell membranes and tissue\n\t-   They could cause biochemical damage or even cancer\n\t-   They can interact with biological systems\n-   There are many potential dangers as nanoparticles can be highly reactive or catalytic due to their large surface area to volume ratio\n-   People need to be careful when dealing with nanoparticles\n\t-   They must wear correct equipment e.g. gloves\n-   The long term effects of nanoparticles in sunscreens is currently unknown","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Chemistry/Patterns":{"title":"Patterns/Trends in the Periodic Table","content":"\n[Go Back](Subjects/Chemistry.md)\n\n**Reactivity of Group 1 Metals increases as there are more valence electron shells**\n\nESF: Electrostatic Forces of Attraction\n\n## Electron Trends in the Periodic Table\n\n### Down a Group:\n\n-   Number of outer shell electrons is the same\n-   Number of complete electron shells increases by 1\n-   Number of a group is the same as the number of electrons in the outer shell of elements in that group, except for group 0\n-   Shielding increases\n-   Atomic radius increases\n\n### Across a Period (Left to Right)\n\n-   Number of outer shell electrons increases by 1\n-   Number of complete electron shells stays the same\n-   The point at which a new period starts is the point at which electrons begin to fill a new shell\n-   Nuclear Charge increases across a period\n-   Shielding is the same across a period\n-   Nuclear Attraction increases across a period\n\n## Valency\n\n-   Valency is the combining power of an atom\n-   Equal to number of hydrogen atoms it can combine with or displace from a compound\n    -   Valency of hydrogen is 1\n-   Valency is not the same as the number of valence electrons\n    -   e.g., Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons but its valency is 3\n\n\n| **Elements**                          | Na    | Mg    | Al    | Si    | P     | S     | Cl    | Ar    |\n| --------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Protons**                           | 11    | 12    | 13    | 14    | 15    | 16    | 17    | 18    |\n| **Nuclear Charge**                    | +11   | +12   | +13   | +14   | +15   | +16   | +17   | +18   |\n| **Electron Configuration**            | 2,8,1 | 2,8,2 | 2,8,3 | 2,8,4 | 2,8,5 | 2,8,6 | 2,8,7 | 2,8,8 |\n| **Shielding (inner shell electrons)** | 10    | 10    | 10    | 10    | 10    | 10    | 10    | 10    |\n| **Nuclear Attraction**                | +1    | +2    | +3    | +4    | +5    | +6    | +7    | +8    |\n| **Atomic Radius**                     | 0.19  | 0.16  | 0.13  | 0.118 | 0.11  | 0.1   | 0.099 | 0.095 |\n\n## Atomic Radius\n\n-   **Atomic Radius:** Distance from the outermost valence electron to the nucleus\n-   Atomic Radius decreases across a period\n    -   The outer electrons are in the same shell but the increasing net nuclear attraction pulls the outer electrons closer to the nucleus\n-   Increases down a group\n    -   Number of protons increases, however, number of shielding electrons increases too.

This uneven distribution of charge is called bond polarity\n\n### **Polar Covalent Bonds**\n- Occur when 2 atoms of different EN share electrons\n- The difference in EN leads to an **uneven sharing of electrons**, thus an uneven distribution of charge, as the electrons spend more time towards the highly EN atom and so the more EN atom becomes partially negative and the less EN atom becomes partially positive\n- The uneven distribution of charge caused by the difference in EN of the atoms involved in the covalent bond is known as a bond dipole as one side of the bond is partially positive, and the other side is partially negative\n\n### **Pure Covalent Bonds**\n\n- Pure covalent bonds form when atoms of equal EN form covalent bonds leading to an equal sharing of electrons and an even distribution of charge between the 2 atoms; leading to no net dipole\n\n### Ionic Bonding\n\n- Ionic bonding occurs when atoms of vastly different EN form covalent bonds leading to a complete transfer of electrons from a lower En atom (usually metal atom) to the highly EN atoms (non metal) resulting in the formation of ions that form ionic bonds due to electrostatic attraction between them\n\n### Net Dipole/Molecular Polarity\n\n- A net dipole is the vector sum of all the bond dipoles occurring within a molecule (greater than 0), due to the molecule being unsymmetrical and there being a net uneven distribution of charge in the molecule\n- This means that one pole/side of the molecule will have a partially positive charge while the other will have a partially negative charge. When there is a net uneven distribution of charge within a molecule and the 2 opposites’ sides’ “poles” have differing charges; a net dipole exists and the molecule is said to be polar\n\n## How to Determine Polarity\n\n1.

Changes in consumer tastes and preferences\n\n\n### Changes in Price/Demand of Related Goods\n\n******Substitutes******\n\n-   Alternative product that can replace another because it satisfies the same want\n-   A.k.a. competitive demand\n-   If the price of one good changes, the demand for the substitute good will change in the same direction\n\n**********************Complements**********************\n\n-   Complementary products must be used at the same time with another to satisfy the same human wants\n-   A.k.a. joint demand\n-   Separate products, but are consumed at the same time\n-   If the price of one good changes, the demand for the complementary good will change in the opposite direction\n\n**********************************************Goods in Derived Demand**********************************************\n\n-   When a good is in derived demand, it is demanded for its contribution to the manufacture of another product\n-   Usually raw materials, e.g. wood\n-   For 2 goods in derived demand, a change in demand for the final good causes a similar change in demand for the resource used to produce it\n\n### Changes in Consumer’s Money Income\n\n************************Normal Goods************************\n\n-   A good is a normal good when demand for it increases in response to an increase in consumer income\n-   Demand for the good varies directly with income\n-   Most goods are normal goods\n    -   Luxury goods, necessities\n-   Increase in income leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve, and vice versa\n-   Purchasing power increases with income, therefore demand increases\n\n****************************Inferior goods****************************\n\n-   Goods where the demand falls as consumer income increases and vice versa\n    -   E.g., cheaper alternatives, like flying with JetStar instead of Singapore Airlines\n-   Demand for the good varies inversely with income\n-   As income increases, consumers switch to more expensive alternatives, so the demand for the inferior good falls\n-   Relative to wants\n-   Increase in income leads to a leftward shift in the demand curve, and vice versa\n-   When income changes, demand will change in the opposite direction\n\n### Changes in Consumer Tastes and Preferences\n\n-   The more desirable a good is to consumers, the higher the demand, and vice versa\n-   Tastes and preferences are affected by advertisements, pop star appeal, age, peers, etc\n    -   Advertisement campaigns\n\n### Demographic Changes\n\n-   Changes in size/composition of population\n-   E.g., Age, if you are old, you will buy less athletic goods\n\n### Changes in Expectations about Future Price Changes\n\n-   If the price is expected to increase, demand will increase, so they have more purchasing power before the increase in price\n    -   Demand curve shifts to the right\n-   Vice versa\n\n## Upward-Sloping Demand Curve\n\n-   Ostentatious goods\n    -   E.g., Luxury items, cars, watches\n-   Price is directly related to quantity demanded\n-   Higher price is perceived as higher quality, resulting in more being bought","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Economics/Introduction2Economics":{"title":"Introduction to Economics","content":"\n[Go back](Subjects/Economics.md)\n\n### Macro-economics vs Micro-economics\n\n-   Macro-economics and Micro-economics are 2 of the largest subdivisions of the study of economics\n-   Micro- refers to the observation of small economics units\n    -

  Scarcity relative to our wants\n-   Resources may be abundant but wants are unlimited, how are the resources allocated: relative scarcity\n-   Due to scarcity, we are forced to make choices\n-   Resources cannot be used for all human wants\n-   We must choose\n-   ****************************************We have unlimited wants, but there is a scarcity of resources to satisfy those wants.

Mention the effect a shortage or surplus has on price\n    1.  “Shortage creates an upward pressure on price”\n    2.  “Surplus creates a downward pressure on price”\n3.  Mention how consumers react to shortage/surplus and the effect a change on price has in quantity demanded\n    1.  In a shortage, consumers offer more for their wants (demand increases), while producers notice this (supply increases) and increase their prices. This decreases quantity demanded and increases quantity supplied\n    2.  In a surplus, consumers offer less for their wants (demand decreases), while producers notice this (supply decreases) and decrease their prices. This increases quantity demanded and decreases quantity supplied\n4.  Mention how shortage/surplus will be eliminated\n    1.  Quantity demanded will continue to decrease and quantity supplied will continue to increase until the shortage is eliminated\n    2.  Quantity demanded will continue to increase and quantity supplied will continue to decrease until the surplus is eliminated\n5.  Mention the final equilibrium point and final effect on equilibrium price and quantity\n    1.  Final equilibrium point is at $E_2$. Price has increased from $P_0$ to $P_1$ and quantity has increased from $Q_0$ to $P_1$\n    2.  Final equilibrium point is at $E_2$.

Excludability\n\t\t- Whether a good is excludable - is it possible to exclude a non-payer from consuming to good to service?\n\t\t- Exclusion of consumers is made possible, or is not costly\n\n### Private Goods\n- Rivalrous in consumption\n\t- Consumption by one person reduces its availability for someone else\n- Excludable in consumption\n\t- It is possible to exclude people from using the good\n\t- Usually achieved by charging a price\n\t- People who refuse to or cannot pay the price are excluded\n- Since most goods are rivalrous, and excludable, most goods are private goodds\n\n### Public Goods\n- Goods that are non-rival and non-excludable are also known as pure public goods\n- Non-rival in consumption\n- Non-excludable in consumption\n\t- Free rider problem\n- No demand (price signals)\n- No supply\n- Hence no market arises (via price mechanism)\n- Provide significant social benefits\n- E.g., lighthouse\n- Socially desirable\n\n### Public Goods and the Free Rider Problem\n\n**Excludable Goods**\n- It is possible to prevent people from buying and using a good simply by charging a price for it; those who do not pay the price do not buy it and do not get to use it\n- Therefore., private firms have an incentive to provide excludable goods because they can charge a price for them, and therefore can cover their costs\n**Non-Excludable Goods**\n- If a non-excludable good were to be produced by a private firm, people could not be prevented from using it even though they would not pay for it\n- Yet no profit-maximising firm would be willing to produce a good it cannot sell at some price\n- As a result, the market fails to produce goods that are non-excludable, giving rise to resource misallocation, as no resources are allocated to the production of public goods\n**The Free Rider Problem**\n- Arises from non-excludability, people cannot be excluded from using the good\n- Public goods are a type of market failure, because due to the free rider problem, private firms do not produce these goods: the market fails to allocate resources to their production\n\n### Common Access Resources\n- A category of market failure is Common Access Resources (CARs)\n- Not owned by any private individual or firm, so do not have a price, but are available for anyone to use without direct payment\n- Hence, without government intervention, these resources are vulnerable to overuse and abuse\n- E.g., fisheries, irrigations, rivers, forests, atmosphere\n- Even for renewable resources, such as fish stocks, the overuse of these resources can lead to a long-term decline beyond the sustainable level in the stock of natural capital\n- **Non-excludable**\n\t- As they are freely available, there tends to be over-consumption of such resources\n\t- Hence, common access resources are difficult to sustain, which is why governments intervene to prevent the depletion or destruction of such goods\n- **Rivalrous**\n\t- Consumption of these resources diminishes the quantity and possibly quality of remaining resources for the current and future generations to use\n\t- In the case of over-consumption of CARs, sustainability becomes a real issue so generations to come may be deprived of any access to these resources\n- **Tragedy of the commons**\n\t- CARs create a situation known as the \"Tragedy of the Commons\"\n\t- This means: Degradation, depletion or destruction of a CAR caused by the problems of overuse (or abuse) and over-consumption\n\t![](11SubjectImages/tragedyofthecommons.png)","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Economics/pricecontrols":{"title":"Application of Demand and Supply - Price Controls","content":"\n## Price Floor\n\n-   Minimum price (lower price limit) allowed by legislation\n-   Government believes equilibrium price is too low\n-   Prices of all affected goods or services transacted cannot be below the minimum price allowed\n-   For a price floor to be effective, the legislated price, $P_{min}$, must be above the market equilibrium price\n-   Surplus occurs, as $Q_{supplied}\u003eQ_{demanded}$\n-   Quantity transacted will fall\n-   Consumer surplus will fall\n-   With government intervention, producers can earn more\n-   A **minimum wag**e may help reduce the income gap between higher and lower wage earners\n\n## Price Ceiling\n\n-   Opposite of a price floor\n-   Maximum price (upper price limit) allowed by legislation\n-   Prices of all affected goods or services transacted cannot be above the maximum price allowed\n-   For a price ceiling to be effective, the legislated price P_{max} must be below the equilibrium price\n-   What alternative means of resource allocation can replace the price mechanism, now that a price ceiling is imposed?\n    1.

Make sure to establish the dominant reading as a point of comparison\n\t- Application of a particular reading practise - that is, a lens you apply to the text (a focus on on a particular concept of ideological presence)\n\t- This is important, to contextualise the writing and helps adopt a sense of genre. 2-3 sentences.

Do you know the text?  Showcase evidence from the text.\n2. Do you know the positioning power of the text? Demonstrate how your evidence reveals technical devices at play.\n3. Your evidence doesn’t ‘clearly show’.  You must then justify how the evidence and its devices create the meaning you have signposted in your paragraph and introduction.\n$$Text+Device=Meaning$$\n\n### Form\n- The structure of this framework is an advised approach \n- E.g., you may like to plan and construct an essay style response. \n- In this instance, you will need to formulate a strong thesis and outline your argument points in your introduction.\n- You then attempt to cohesively persuade your marker of your argument throughout your paragraphs and structure a concluding paragraph in a powerful and convincing way.\n- These essays lend themselves to a reading lens or personal response.  \n\t- E.g., an in-depth and multifaceted Feminist or Resistant reading.\n\n### Expression and Terminology\n- Your response will need to employ a formal register – avoid contractions, colloquialisms, and figures of speech\n- Essentially, your written expression should be appropriately sophisticated for this level of English (See: Expression in Secondary Criticisms)\n- Appropriate critical, linguistic, and analytical terminology is a must\n- Overly simplistic or repetitive language will greatly weaken the strength of your analysis/argument\n- Ensure that your response uses appropriate metalanguage in its discussion of idea\n- Evidence should be contextualised and effectively integrated into sentences \n- E.g.: “It is only the author’s Indigenous identity which could imply that lines such as “not being grateful”  (line  21) indicate  a  subversive  reversal  of  the  idea  that  Indigenous  Australians  should  in  some  way  be  grateful  to  the  Australian  government,  or  that  “innocence  lost/to  the  crooked  men”  (lines  31–32)  would  refer  to  colonisation” (Barratt-Peacock 2019).","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.925952719Z","tags":null},"/11Literature/Conventions":{"title":"Narrative Conventions and Language Devices","content":"\n[go back](Subjects/Literature.md)\n\n## **Narrative conventions:**\nCharacterisation (SAAO)  \n\nSetting (physical, context)\n\nPoint of View\n- 1st person\n\t- I, me\n- 2nd person\n\t- You, we, us \n\t- E.g., choose your own adventure books\n- 3rd person\n\t- They, them, him, her\n\t- Omniscient\n\t\t- In more than 1 person’s consciousness, e.g., switching consciousnesses\n\t- Limited\n\t\t- Only in 1 person’s consciousness, e.g., only protagonist’s perspective\n\nPlot (internal/external conflict, structure)\n\nSymbolism\n\n## **Language techniques**\nTone (achieved through syntax, diction and punctuation).  \n\nStyle (formal, conversational, factual, lyrical).  \n\nEmotive language  \n\nDescriptive language\n-        Describing things, e.g. _warm_ fire, etc\n\nConnotative language\n-        Associated things with described object (implications)\n-        E.g., warmth and safety for home\n\nFigurative language\n- Metaphors  \n- Similes  \n- Personification  \n- Hyperbole  \n\nAllusion  \n\nSymbolism  \n\nRepetition\n\nOxymoron\n\n**Characterisation**\nCharacterisation is important to analyse in a text as it reveals a lot about the message of the text. The characters are usually the vessel by which the author tells the story. Are the characters typical of a genre? Do they fit a certain archetype? Are some characters good and some evil?  \nRemember, it’s how _you_ perceive the character.\n\n**Setting**\nAn understanding of setting will assist you with all different types of narrative texts. In certain genres such as wester and horror, the setting is very fundamental. However, no matter the text, the setting is going to play a key role.\n\n**Plot (Structure)**\nHow has the text been structured? Is there a flashback? Does it loop? The structure of the text is important in identifying how the author wants you as a reader to uncover his message. This is highly important in short stories, also.\n\n**Syntax**\nSyntax is the way that words and phrases are put together in a sentence. Sometimes authors will adhere to syntax and sometimes they will play around with the syntax, which is just as significant. Take a look at the syntax and try to understand what is going on with the author’s writing.\n\n**Tone**\nThe tone of a novel or story is a big determinant in the message of the narrative. It is important to identify tone, whether it be serious or sarcastic.  \nIdentify adjectives and try to find the mood/tone it creates.\n\n**Style**\nWhat style has been employed to write this narrative? This will require you understanding the key terminology surrounding style.  \nHow the story is written.\n\n**Dialogue**\nDialogue is anytime that someone speaks within your narrative. It can be very telling about a number of things and can reveal things about your characters, in a different way to your narrator.\n\n**Emotive language**\nThe use of emotive language is very significant is it positions the reader to “feel” what the author wants them to. This is important when talking about serious issues.\n\n**Point of view**\nFirst-person, second person, third person limited and third-person omniscient are all different methods of an author telling a story. Each of these is significant in their own right.\n\n**Statistics**\nData on a subject, e.g., number of unemployed people\n\n**Expert opinion**\nA professional giving an opinion on a subject they have studied\n\n**Metaphors**\nA metaphor is a useful language tool that compares two things that have nothing in common. E.g. Lost in a sea of nameless faces.\n\n**Similes**\nA simile is when something is said to be like something else. E.g. Her smile was as bright as a sun.\n\n**Personification**\nPersonification is when an inanimate object is assigned with a human-like quality. E.g., The daffodils danced in the breeze.\n\n**Hyperbole**\nThis is an exaggeration of the fact. E.g., She was so hungry she could have eaten a horse\n\n**Imagery**\nA great author can conjure up pictures in your mind through the use of imagery. This is a very descriptive language that paints a visual picture.\n\n**Allusion**\nAn allusion is a reference to something else. E.g., Bec was the Trojan horse to Marta’s social group. Think “Easter Eggs”  \n  \n\n**Symbolism**\nSymbolism can be anything from a dagger to colour and usually has a hidden meaning.  \nSomething that represents something else.

This can be represented in a nuclear equation where the changes occurring in the nuclei can be seen. Electrons are **not considered** in these equations, only nucleons. The equation for the alpha decay of uranium-238 is: $$^{238}_{92}U -\u003e^{234}_{90}Th+^4_2 He^{2+}+energy$$\nIn the decay process, the parent nucleus **238-92-U** has spontaneously emitted an alpha particle (⍺) and has changed into a completely different element, **234-90-Th.** Thorium-234 is called the daughter nucleus. The energy released is mostly kinetic energy carried by the fast-moving alpha particle. When an atom changes into a different element, it is said to have undergone a **nuclear transmutation**. In nuclear transmutations, electric charge is conserved—seen as a conservation of atomic number In the example, 90+2 = 92. The number of nucleons  is also conserved; 234+4 = 238.\n\n## **Beta Decay**\n-   Beta particles are electrons\n-   Originated from **nucleus** of a radioactive atom \n-   Not from electron cloud\n-   Can be written as:\n$$^0_{-1}e^{-}$$\n$$^0 _{-1}\\beta ^-$$\n  \n\n-   The atomic number of -1 indicates that it has a single negative charge\n-   Mass number of 0 indicates its mass is far less than a proton or neutron\n-   Beta decay occurs in nuclei where there is an imbalance of neutrons to protons\n-   Typically, if a light nucleus has too many neutrons to be stable, a neutron will spontaneously change into a proton\n- Ionising ability is medium\n\t- Since it is negatively charged, it is repelled by the electron cloud of other atoms\n\t- Experiences a large number of collisions, but expends less energy from them\n\t- Therefore less ionising\n-   Electron and a uncharged massless particle called an **antineutrino** are ejected to restore the nucleus to a more stable state\n- Antineutrino is symbolised as $\\overline{V}$ \n\n**Example**\nIsotopes of carbon: **C-12-6, C-13-6 and C-14-6**. Carbon-12 and 13 are both stable, but carbon 14 is unstable. It has more neutrons, and therefore undergoes a beta decay to be stable. In the process, one of the neutrons changes into a proton. As a result, the proton number increases to 7, and so the product is not carbon. Nitrogen-14 is formed. The nuclear equation for this decay is: $$^{14}_{6}C-\u003e {^{14}_{6}N}+{^0_{-1}e+ \\overline{V}+energy}$$The transformation taking place in the nucleus is: $$^1_0n-\u003e^1_0p+^0_{-1}e+ \\overline{V}$$\n-   n: neutrons\n-   p: protons\n-   e: beta particle\nOnce again, notice how in all these equations, the atomic and mass numbers are conserved. The antineutrino has no charge and has so little mass that both its atomic and mass numbers are 0\n\n### Beta Decay (Positrons)\n- A different form of beta decay occurs in atoms that have too many protons\n- A proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (β+). This is known as a β+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron\n- Positrons have the same properties as electrons, but their electrical charge is positive rather than negative. Positrons are an example of antimatter.\n\n**Example**\nThe radioactive decay of unstable nitrogen-12. There are 7 protons and 5 neutrons in the nucleus, and a proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (β+). This is known as a β+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron. The equation is: $${^{14}_{6}N}-\u003e^{14}_{6}C+{^0_{+1}e+ \\overline{V}+energy}$$\n\n### Gamma Decay\n- Generally, after a radioisotope has emitted an alpha/beta particle, the daughter nucleus holds an excess of energy\n- The protons and neutrons in the daughter nucleus then rearrange slightly and offload this excess energy by releasing gamma radiation (high-frequency electromagnetic radiation)\n- Ionising ability is low\n\t- Interact with matter infrequently when they collide directly with the nucleus or an electron\n\t- Low density of the atom makes this infrequent, therefore it cannot dislodge electrons as much as beta particles\n\t- Low ionisation ability\n- Gamma rays—like all light—have no mass and are uncharged\n- However, it contains a lot of energy\n- Symbol is: $$^0_0 \\gamma$$\n- Being a form of light, gamma rays travel at the speed of light\n- Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation/waves, and have the shortest wavelength\n- They are photons\n\n**Example:**\nA common example of a gamma ray emitter is iodine-131. Iodine-131 decays by beta and gamma radiation to form xenon-131. The equation for this is: $$^{131}_{53}I-\u003e{^{131}_{54}Xe+^0_{-1}e+^0_0 \\gamma}$$\n**These equations can also be written with $\\alpha,\\beta$ or $\\gamma$ written over the reaction arrow**\n\n| Type of Radiation   | Alpha                                                    | Beta                                                   | Gamma                                                |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| Symbol              | $^4_2 He$ or $^4_2 \\alpha$                               | $^0_{-1} \\beta ^-$ or $^0_{-1}e^-$                     | $^0_0 \\gamma$                                        |\n| Mass (amu)          | 4                                                        | $\\frac{1}{1836}$                                       | 0                                                    |\n| Charge              | 2+                                                       | -

Element is bombarded with neutrons\n2.  Neutrons are absorbed\n3.  Nucleus becomes unstable and splits into smaller nuclei, radioactive energy and lone neutrons\n\n### **Nuclear Power Stations**\n**Pros**\n-   Energy efficient\n-   Small land footprint\n-   Average nuclear power plant producing 2000 MW takes up a square mile of space\n-   Very powerful, energy wise\n-   Reliable\n-   Produce their maximum power output 93% of the time\n-   Very stable\n-   Produces no greenhouse gases\n**Cons**\n-   Closely connected to nuclear weapon technology production/proliferation\n-   Dangerous to society\n-   Nuclear waste\n-   Extremely poisonous products\n-   Takes 10s of 1000s of years to stop being radioactive/poisonous\n-   Possibility of nuclear accidents\n-   Uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions\n-   Neutrons from fission reaction create another fission reaction\n-   Causes excess of energy in the form of heat\n-   Sometimes the heat is too much for the reactor to handle\n-   It melts, and radioactive waste is expelled\n-   Expensive to set up\n-   Uranium is expensive\n\n**Nuclear Power Station Components**\n-   Fuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium\n-   Moderator: material that slows down neutrons\n-   Graphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide\n-   Heavy water is the best but is too expensive\n-   Water with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen\n-   Graphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen\n-   Ensures that neutron capture occurs\n-   When the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy\n-   Control rods: material that absorbs neutrons\n-   Boron steel or cadmium\n-   Ensures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission\n-   Coolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down\n\t-   e.g. water\n-   Radiation shield: thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor![](11SubjectImages/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%208.00.46%20pm.png)\n\n## **Uses of Radiation**\n### **Medical Tracers**\n-   Radioactive substance injected into the body\n-   Usually iodine, as it is absorbed by the thyroid gland\n-   They measure the gamma radiation emitted to track pathways or image the body\n-   Gamma is used as it is very penetrative (easier to measure from surface), and is less deadly in equal amounts (from the inside) than alpha and beta\n### **Industrial Tracers**\n-   Radioactive substance used in factories/industrial use\n-   Much the same concept as a medical tracer\n-   Injected into the system\n-   Finds leaks in systems, or tracks certain chemicals\n-   You can use a radioactive tracer if any escapes\n### **X-Rays**\n-   Electromagnetic waves are directed at the area of concern\n-   A material is placed behind the area\n-   The x-ray penetrates your body and into the area\n-   They image the shadows in the area to find out what’s wrong\n-   The bones absorb the x-ray, making this very useful, as we can see shadows, of the bone, or we can observe the brighter sections to view the muscles\n### **Radiometric/Carbon Dating**\n-   Radioactive dating uses the known half-life of an isotope and its composition to determine the age of a specimen\n-   The most common is carbon dating, but that’s only good for 40-50000 years\n-   When an archeological specimen is created in its time, it will mostly be carbon 14, but will slowly, over thousands of years, decay into nitrogen 14\n-   By measuring how much nitrogen/carbon 14 is present, we can very accurately determine the age of the specimen by comparing it to the carbon-12 levels of living things\n-   Carbon has a half life of 5730 years\n-   Since it’s only good for 40-50000 years, it’s good for measuring the age of human artefacts and similar things, but useless for determining things in the millions, e.g. dinosaur fossils, ancient rock formations\n-   For this, we use the decay of uranium into lead, which takes around 4.5 billion years\n-   By measuring how much lead is present, we can also determine the age of this specimen![](11SubjectImages/Contamination.png)\n\n## **Definitions**\n**Decay:** occurs when unstable nuclei breakdown into smaller parts, sitting small particles with high energy\n\n**Radioactive

But I probably won't change my mind. I'm kinda sick of the whole mentality of being dominated by Christian and his erratic ideas. \n\nEver since Christian started being a *little* aggressive with his control over the Town, it's become toxic beyond belief. I literally can't even share and contribute notes without both being criticised and then threatened to be removed from the town. Now I'm not even sure I want a website anymore, if people are going to be this mean :(\n\nI believe in free education. I believe in free speech. I believe in critical discourse. But this is too far. I have a right to my own work, and I have a right to that work being respected. \n\nI don't hold any resentment towards the majority of the town people. They are just there for the ride. But I think I'm going to move away from the town. Settle down somewhere better and make my own place on the internet. \n\nIn truth, I want to be able to control who sees my website to a greater extent. I don't think Github is able to offer this. Furthermore I want to decrease visibility of the code (and the md files) so that people like Christian can't just look at old versions and take things I've asked not to use.\n\nFor the rest of the town, I'm still here if you need any coding help. I am glad to help people set up their own websites, regardless of whether they align with the town or not.\n\nThe town had so much potential. It probably still does. Maybe it can thrive without me. But I can't stand to be there anymore, given how unequal it is, how I and my intellectual work is being mistreated for an agenda I don't fully agree with. \n\nI still have dreams of a decentralised mechanism, of a town that has reached its true potential. Those dreams will never die, and I will work to see that dream reached. \n\nI wanted to integrate the town with CARD and the Past Papers drive, to make something truly great, and to prove that you don't need to pay to have good resources. I guess that dream is still attainable, just without the town. \n\nI'm sure this seems like a very silly, childish reaction. But no, I've been thinking about this for a long time. Ever since it first happened, the thought that Christian, or other people, could just take my work for granted and worst of all, against my own will, disgusted me in a way that was both infuriating and melancholic (thanks christian).\n\nI truly wish all the members of the town the best. It would be truly rewarding to see in a few months (or weeks) that the town is prospering, and that for a brief moment I was part of it.\n\nI desperately wish the town could've been as I hoped; safe, collaborative, encouraging, etc. Maybe that was too much to ask. But that's all right. \n\nHoping for a better future,\n\n*a very sadge ed*","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.981953824Z","tags":null},"/Writings/10-04-2023_Stasis":{"title":"10-04-2023 Stasis","content":"\n*a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium*\n\nThe website will be taken down.

Unfortunately, this version will actually be mostly a downgrade of the previous one. Excluding bug fixes, I plan to pull back on most of the \"open-source\" features of the website.\n\nCurrently, I'm struggling to figure out whether I should change the license for the repo, but that would go against Jzhao's MIT license. In fact, now I'm contemplating whether I should even have a website. I feel like my values more align with Pranav at this moment. Information is available, but at my own discretion. \n\nNot all is bad. Alongside some minor fixes, **obsidiannotes-v.4** will be released *alongside* a new, great project of mine. One that's top secret, but will (hopefully) be revolutionary.\n\nNow this is the important bit. I am considering making a new town, separate from the current town, with its own goals and rules outlined from the start.

You might've heard of it. It's only the best selling video game franchise of all time. Not just the story mode, but also the competitive mode, also known as VGC, or Video Game Competition formats. I played on [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), but this year, I had the chance to attend a physical, official event known as the Perth Regionals.\n\nThis event was spread out over 2 days, the 3rd and 4th of March. Players would compete in 7 rounds of Best of 3, and the top 8 would move onto the 2nd day. 3 points were allocated for a win, and 0 points were added for a loss, with 1 point being added for draws. The 8 players with the highest amount of points would move on to the next day. Your ranking was also determined by the opponents you faced. For example, someone who beat the top player but only had 1 win would be ranked higher than someone who beat the bottom player with 1 win.\n\nThis was in the Series 2 format, which allowed Paradox Pokémon, and the regional Paldea Dex, apart from the Ruins. If you have no idea what it is, just search it up. It was an Open Team Sheet format, which meant we could see our opponent's Pokémon and their moves, abilities, items, and Tera-type, but not their stats.\n\nI competed in the VGC Masters Division, which consists of people 16 years and over.\n\n## Teambuilding\n\n\u003e [!quote] Alpharad\n\u003e \n\u003e \"I don't know if any of you dabble in competitive Pokémon, but if you do, you should know what Flutter Mane is!\"\n\nI had a lot of trouble making/finding a team to use, as I hadn't finished the game yet, and I didn't get much time to play. My friends Kat and Preston were kind enough to build the team for me, so all I had to do was find a team. I ended up settling on this team here, which was covered by CybertronVGC in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvyGNSWsdPU).\n![](writings%20images/vgc_thing.png)\n\nThe strategy revolved around Iron Moth's Acid Spray, which does damage and lowers Special Defence by 2 stages. Flutter Mane and Glimmora, being special attackers, would take advantage of this. Kingambit and Dondozo were for physical moves and bulk, as my team was a hyper-offense team. Tatsugiri was there, because....it just works well with Dondozo. All had defensive Tera-Types except for Flutter Mane and Tatsugiri. \n\n\nI managed to squeeze in a bit of practice on Showdown, but only managed to get a few games off in the in-game ladder. \n\n## The Start of the Event\n\nThe day arrived on 3rd of March, 2023. As always, I didn't sleep well, and saw immediately that most of the competition was adults. Most of them had flown in from other states. I saw a few people with merch from Worlds (the Pokémon World Championships, which was held in London last year). Daunted, but still determined to win, I entered the venue.\n\nThere were 131 people registered for the tournament, but only 113 participants for some reason....I have no idea why.\n\nThere were some people wearing awesome merch. There was a Greninja cosplayer, a person with a Tera-Ghost Garganacl shirt with the phrase, \"It gets worse\", a guy with a Palafin t-shirt (that alone terrified me...) and a Mimikyu cosplayer.\n\n## The Playoffs\n\n### Round 1\n\nMy first match was against Chris Marr. His team was a hyper-offensive team. It had 2 main strategies; 1: use Beat Up with Maushold on the Annihilape to increase its power for Rage Fist, and 2: Tailwind with Murkrow, and sweep with Iron Moth, Flutter Mane, and Tyranitar. Overall, this match-up was good for me, but I just couldn't do anything. I made some bad plays, and lost the set 2-0. I hadn't gotten warmed up, so I played pretty badly.\n![](writings%20images/ChrisMarr.png)\n\n### Round 2\n\nThe next match was against Matthew Robinson, someone who had flown in from Melbourne. His team was a full Trick Room team. He always started off with his Armarouge and Indeedee, and always used Trick Room. I couldn't do anything to stop it, and looking back, there's nothing I could've done. His team was just too good, and it was a really bad match-up. I lost the set, 2-0. Again, I still wasn't fully warmed up, but even if I was, I don't think I could've won\n![](writings%20images/MatthewRobinson.png)\n\n### Round 3\n\nMy third match was against Zack Stalker, another Trick Room user. However, he also had some fast Pokémon in the back, like Hydreigon, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle. I still hadn't fully warmed up, but was getting into my groove. I played way better this match, but I still couldn't win. I lost the set, 2-1.\n![](writings%20images/ZackStalker.png)\n\nI was feeling pretty down at this point. I had gone 3 losses, 0 wins, and I really didn't want to lose any more. Kat was on 2 wins 1 loss, and Preston was also on 3 losses, 0 wins. We all felt really bad, and resolved to win our next matches.\n\n### Round 4\n\nMy next match was against James Powell, a Perth local who had participated in a few local tournaments. His team was a pretty standard team, with 3 support mons, and 3 strong offence mons. He always lead with Iron Hands and Gothitelle. I deduced that he would double Fake Out on the first turn, so I Tera-Ghost'd my Iron Moth, and become immune to it. He did this in both rounds, and I took advantage. I made some pretty good plays, and won the set 2-0.\n![](writings%20images/JamesPowell.png)\n\n### Round 5\n\nMy fifth match was against a Chinese player named Jiangyue Chen. His team was a stall team, and was based on 1 major strategy: Mortal Spin with Glimmora or Salt cure with Garganacl, and just Protect/Spiky Shield, or bring in some bulky mons like Dondozo, Corviknight, or Iron Hands. My team was really bad against his team, but Glimmora and Kingambit carried, and I made some good plays. I won the set, 2-0.\n![](writings%20images/jiangyuechen.png)\n\n### Round 6\n\nThe next match was against Jackson Lee Kong, another Perth local about my age. He was kind enough to give me his team. His team was a very offensive team, much like mine. His main strategies were:\n1. Using Scope Lens and Focus Energy to hit Critical hits, and ignore stat drops\n2. Use Iron Bundle and Weavile in tandem with each other, as Assurance has 120 base power when the target is hit. He could use Icy Wind and Assurance to sweep teams\n3. Just using all of his mons to provide offensive pressure\nI was pretty used to offensive teams, so I didn't have too much trouble. I will say this though: He included Weavile because it was his favourite Pokémon, so I don't care what anyone says, that man is **BASED**.\n![](writings%20images/JacksonLeeKong.png)\n\n### Round 7\n\nBy now, I'm feeling pretty good. I've evened out my losses and wins, and am now at 3 wins, 3 losses. My last match will decide my ranking. Determined to win, I go into the 7th round.\n\nIt's the Palafin guy. Oh my days, his team was so good. His team was another hyper-offensive team that I didn't match up well against. I won the first set by manoeuvring well. He took the 2nd set by taking advantage of my Pokémon choices. In the third set, I was feeling pretty nervous. I didn't want to have a bad win:lose ratio, but it was my last match, so I wanted to have some fun. In the past, I always lead with Iron Moth and Flutter Mane, and Terastallised my Flutter Mane, and it worked pretty well. The thing is, he always lead with Iron Bundle. I knew that he was going to Hydro Pump into the Iron Bundle like he did in Game 2, and this would OHKO it. I could've protected Iron Bundle and attacked with Flutter Mane, and in retrospect, this was the safest thing to do. But I didn't want to do that. I thought, \"What if Hydro Pump missed?\". I took a 20% chance that it would miss, and based my whole strategy off that. The first turn comes. His Iron Bundle uses Hydro Pump. The seconds tick by....and he misses Hydro Pump. My Iron Bundle uses Acid Spray on his Flutter Mane, and I Terastallise my Flutter Mane, use Dazzling Gleam, and OHKO both his Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. He brings out Tyranitar and Arcanine, but the sheer force of my hyper-offensive team overwhelm him. I win the set and the round, 2-1.\n![](writings%20images/DimitriKoziaris.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, considering that I was against adults that flew in from all over the country, I think I did rather well. I placed 55th out of 113 participants, and had a Round win to loss ratio of 4:3, and a Set win to loss ratio of 9:7. I finished with 12 points, and got a participation price of a \"Boss's Orders\" Pokémon Regionals Card, and a Regidrago playmat. I didn't manage to get into Day 2, but I still had a ton of fun.\n\nI had a great time there. I met some new people and made some new friends, and everyone there was so nice. Never once did I encounter a bad sport. I would 100% do this again, and would recommend anyone who is able to, to do so as well.","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T03:31:32.981953824Z","tags":null},"/Writings/town":{"title":"Town Analogy","content":"\nWe're all trying to survive, right?\n\nWelp.
