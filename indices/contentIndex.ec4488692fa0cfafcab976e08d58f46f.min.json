According to US law, the jury for a trial has to come from the state and district in which the crime took place. However, since this small bit of Idaho has no people living in it, and is also part of a separate court district from the rest of the state, hypothetically the court would be unable to assemble a jury and thus unable to convict you. \n\u003e \n\u003e Disclaimer: This is a technicality, so don't try this.\n\nI'm ‚ú®6'10\"‚ú®, in case you were wondering.

Body's Defences","content":"\n[go back](10Subjects/10Biology.md)\n\n## Pathogens\n- Pathogens are microbes¬†\n- Micro-organism or other agent that causes disease\n- Not all microbes are pathogens\n- Many types of pathogens that are beneficial to organisms \n\n## Vaccination\n- Acts to increase the host‚Äôs resistance to an pathogen\n- Administration of a material that stimulates adaptive immunity to a disease\n\n## **External Non-Specific Defences**\n\n### **Skin**\n- Provides physical barrier to prevent pathogens from entering the body\n- Dead skin cells are constantly sloughed off, making it difficult for invading bacteria to colonise\n- Has low pH between 4.7-5.7, making it difficult for many pathogens to grow\n- Chemical secretions e.g. sebum (oil) and antimicrobial peptides hamper growth of bacteria and fungi\n### **Mucous Membrane**\n- Lines cavities of the respiratory (lungs, nose, mouth), urinary, reproductive and digestive tracts\n- Excrete mucus that protects the underlying cell layers\n- Traps particles including pathogens\n- Contains anti-microbial peptides\n- Mucus in respiratory tract can be swallowed and destroyed in the stomach, coughed up or sneezed out\n### **Hairs and Cilia**\n- Hairs line the\n\t- Nose cavity\n\t- Ears\n- Trap bacteria in mucous on the hairs/cilia\n- Cilia\n\t- Tiny hair-like projections\n\t- Located on the mucous membranes of respiratory tract including the nose cavity, trachea, lungs etc\n\t- Beating motion moves the mucus with the trapped particles towards the throat to be swallowed or coughed up\n### **Acids**\n- Stomach juices are highly acidic\n\t- Kills ingested bacteria and many pathogens in swallowed mucus¬†\n\t- pH: 1-2\n- Vaginal acids\n\t- Reduces growth of micro-organisms\n- Sweat is slightly acidic\n\t- Contains lysosome(bacteria-killing enzyme)\n- Earwax is slightly acidic\n\t- Contains lysosome\n\t- Protects outer-ear from some pathogenic bacteria\n\n\n## **4 Protective Reflexes**\n\n### **Sneezing**\n- Stimulus = when the walls of the nasal cavity are irritated by:\n\t- Noxious fumes\n\t- Dust particles that may carry organisms\n- Result of stimulus = forceful expulsion of air from the lungs out through the nose and mouth\n- The air expelled may carry mucus, foreign particles, irritating gases\n### **Coughing**\n- Stimulus = irritation in lower respiratory tract (bronchi and bronchioles)\n- Result of stimulus = expulsion of air from lungs\n- The expelled air drives mucus and foreign matter up the trachea towards throat and mouth\n### **Vomiting**\n- Induced by either\n\t- Psychological stimuli (pain, sight, smell, emotion)\n\t- Excess stretching of stomach (gasses)\n\t- Bacterial toxins\n- Expulsion of bile, acid and digested/undigested matter from stomach\n- Expels waste, and potentially pathogens from stomach\n### **Diarrhoea**¬†\n- Results due to irritation of small and large intestines by either\n\t- Viruses\n\t- Bacteria\n\t- Protozoa\n- Irritation causes increased contractions of muscles leading to rapid removal or irritant\n- Faeces is watery as material does not remain in large intestine long enough for water absorption\n\n## Internal Non-Specific Defences\n\n### Phagocytosis\n‚ÅÉ Process where a cell binds to the item it wants to engulf on the cell surface and draws the item inward while engulfing around it\n\n### Phagocytes\n‚ÅÉ Type of cell\n‚ÅÉ Phagocytes are attracted by an inflammatory response of damaged cells\n‚ÅÉ Engulfs microorganisms that penetrate our external defences\n\n### Phagocytic Leukocytes\n‚ÅÉ Neutrophils (Neutrophilic \\[stained only by neutral dyes] white blood cell)\n‚ÅÉ Macrophages (develop from monocytes)\n\n![](images/Pasted%20Graphic.png)\n\n### Inflammatory Response (Inflammation)\n- Response to any tissue damage\n- Reduces spread of pathogens, destroys them and prevents the entry of additional pathogens\n- Removes damaged tissue and cell debris\n- Begins repair of damaged tissue\n- Signs of inflammation: REDNESS, SWELLING, HEAT AND PAIN\n- **Steps**\n\t1. Mast cells release histamine, heparin and other substances into the tissue fluid. Mast cells stimulate and co-ordinate inflammation by releasing chemicals. Mast cells are present in most cells.\n\t2. Histamine increases blood flow to the area and causes blood capillaries to become more permeable so that fluid is filtered from the blood. This increased blood flow causes the heat and redness, the escape of fluid from the body causes the swelling\n\t3. Heparin is an anticoagulant therefore prevents clotting in the immediate area of the injury. A clot of build around the damaged area forms, and this slows the spread of pathogens to healthy tissue\n\t4. Chemicals released by mast cells attract phagocytes. Macrophages and leucocytes actively consume micro-organisms and debris by phagocytosis\n\t5. Pain receptors are stimulated\n\t6. The phagocytes filled with bacteria, cell debris and dead cells, begin to die. The dead phagocytes and tissue fluid form a yellow fluid called pus\n\t7. New cells are produced by mitosis and repair of damaged tissues takes place\n\n### Fever\n- Increases in body temperature due to resetting of the body‚Äôs thermostat (controlled by the hypothalamus) to a higher level\n- The individual feels cold. Vasoconstrictions of the vessels of the skin and shivering occur to conserve heat and increase heat production. The body temperature increases rapidly.\n- When the fever breaks, the individual feels very hot and appears fused due to vasodilation of the vessels of the skin and profuse sweating occurs\n- High temperature inhibits growth of some bacteria and viruses AND speeds up rate of chemical reactions which may help in cell repair\n\n\n## Specific Defences\n\n### **Parts of the Immune System**\n- White blood cells\n\t- Protect body from infection\n- Lymph nodes\n\t- Glands that filter pathogens to make sure that they don‚Äôt spread further\n\t- They then activate, replicate and send the lymphocytes to fight the invader\n- Spleen\n\t- Stores white blood cells\n\t- Filters blood, destroys old and damaged red-blood cells\n- Tonsils and adenoids\n\t- Located in nasal passage¬†\n\t- Trap foreign invaders\n\t- Immune cells produce antibodies to prevent infection\n- Thymus\n\t- Organ in upper chest\n\t- Learns to recognise and remember an invader, so that next time the invader comes, it can be swiftly neutralised\n\t- Also helps develop certain white blood cells\n- Bone Marrow\n\t- Stem cells in the marrow develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and other types of immune cells\n\t- Generate blood cells and release them into bloodstream\n- External Non-specific defences\n- Stomach and bowel\n\t- Acids may kill pathogens after they enter your body\n\t- Also contain beneficial bacteria that kill harmful bacteria\n\n### **Major Blood Components**\n- Red blood cells (erythrocytes)\n\t- Transport oxygen to your tissue from your lungs\n\t- Contain haemoglobin, which allows them to carry oxygen\n- White Blood cells (leukocytes)\n\t- Protect body from infection\n\t- Circulate in blood and respond to infection and illness\n\t- T-cells grow in thymus gland and lymph nodes\n\t- B-cells grow in spleen\n- Plasma\n\t- Liquid component of blood that contains all the proteins in the blood\n- Platelets (Thrombocytes)\n\t- Smallest component of blood that seals bleeding\n\t- Platelets will cluster at the site of bleeding and seal the vessel to clot bleeding\n\n### Leucocytes\n- White blood cells that are able to leave the capillaries and migrate through the tissues to places of infection or injury\n- Some secrete substances that destroy bacteria before engulfing them\n- Others engulf live bacteria and digest them\n\n### Lymphocytes\n- Type of leucocytes\n- Part of the cellular immune system\n- 3 types:\n\t- T-lymphocytes\n\t\t- Can recognise antigens\n\t\t- Can destroy pathogens\n\t- B-lymphocytes\n\t\t- Produce antigens to combat infection\n\t- Natural Killer (NK) Cells\n\t\t- Kill infected cells\n\n### Macrophages\n- Large phagocytic cells that develop from leucocytes\n- Some are wandering cells that move through tissues looking for and destroying pathogens\n- Some are in fixed position\n- Either engulf and digest microorganisms or release substances that destroy them\n- These processes eliminate many pathogens before an infection has a chance to take hold","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.527398064Z","tags":[]},"/10Biology/Immunity":{"title":"Immunity","content":"\n[go back](10Subjects/10Biology.md)\n\n## **Innate Immunity**\n- Based on genetic make-up\n- Relies on already formed components\n- Rapid response: within minutes of infection\n- Not specific\n\t- Same molecules/cells respond to a range of pathogens\n- Has no memory\n\t- Same response after repeated exposure\n- Does not lead to clonal expansion\n\t- Clonal expansion: explosive increase in number of lymphocytes\n### **Mechanisms**\n- Mechanical barriers/surface secretion\n\t- Skin\n\t- Acidic pH in stomach\n\t- Cilia\n- Humoral mechanisms (mediated by macromolecules, e.g. cells)\n\t- Lysosomes, basic proteins, complement, interferons¬†\n- Cellular defence mechanisms\n\t- Natural killer cells\n\t- Neutrophils\n\t- Macrophages\n\t- Mast cells\n\t- Basophils¬†\n\t- Eosinophils\n\n\n## **Adaptive Immunity**\n- Based on resistance acquired during life\n- Relies on genetic events and cellular growth\n- Responds more slowly, over a few days\n- Is more specific\n\t- Each cell responds to a single epitope on an antigen\n- Has anamnestic memory\n\t- Repeated exposure leads to faster, stronger, response\n- Leads to clonal expansion\n\n### **Mechanisms**\n- Cell-mediated immune response (CMIR)\n\t- T-lymphocytes\n\t- Eliminate intracellular microbes that survive within phagocytes or other infected cells\n\t- Doesn‚Äôt use antibodies\n- Humoural Immune Reponse (HIR)\n\t- B-lymphocytes\n\t- - Mediated by antibodies\n\t- Eliminate extra-cellular microbes and their toxins\n\n#### Cell-mediated immune response\n1.

Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule\n2.  Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain. Start at the end that will give the smallest numbers possible to the carbon atoms where the branches originate\n3.  Substituents = atoms attached to the parent chain. **Alkyl group:** A substituent that is a hydrocarbon. The names of alkyl groups use the same prefixes as the alkanes, but with a -yl suffix, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. Substituents are named by placing the carbon number from the parent carbon chain in front of the name with the substituent.¬†\n4.  Use a prefix to indicate the appearance of more than one of the same substituent in the structural formula. 2 of the same group is di-, 3 is tri-, 4 is tetra\n5.  Multiple different substituents are listed in alphabetical order. Ignore any of the prefixes from rule 4.\n6.  Commas are used to separate multiple numbers. Hyphens come between the number and name of a substituent. The parent name comes immediately after the last substituent. There are no spaces in the name\n\n### **Melting and boiling points: Alkanes**\n-   Alkanes have low melting or boiling points\n-   Due to very weak intermolecular forces between alkane molecules\n-   Methane, ethane and butane are gases at room temperature\n-   As the carbon chain gets longer, because the attraction between the molecules increases, therefore more energy is needed to overcome the attraction¬†\n-   Branched isomers have lower boiling/melting points, because the branches prevent the molecules from getting close so they cannot attract to each other as strongly\n\n### **Van der Waal‚Äôs forces**\n-   Named after Dutch scientist J D Van der Waal who discovered them\n-   The forces are created by the constant movements of electrons in atoms of molecules at high speeds\n-   At any instant in time there is the likelihood that one side of the molecule has a greater proportion of electrons\n-   This is called a dipole, and causes the molecule to have positively and negatively charged ends\n-   A temporary dipole or imbalance of charge can attract the electron cloud from a neighbouring atom or molecule, e.g. slightly positive end attracts negatively charged electrons\n-   The temporary dipole induces an imbalance of charges in neighbouring molecules\n-   The strength of the VdW force is dependent on the size of the molecules or atoms\n-   As the size and molecular mass of the molecule increases so does the number of electrons, resulting in a greater imbalance of charge, and therefore a greater VdW attraction\n-   This is why boiling points increase as the number of carbon atoms increase in alkanes, more energy is required to overcome the VdW forces\n\n### **Viscosity of Alkanes**\n-   Methane, ethane, propane, butane = gases at room temperature\n-   Alkanes from pentane through to C16 are liquids\n-   The viscosity of liquid alkanes increases as the number of carbon atoms increase\n-   The increase in viscosity is due to the increase of intermolecular forces between molecules of increasing size\n\n### **Volatility of Alkanes**\n-   High volatility: low boiling point\n-   High volatility: weak intermolecular forces, thus fewer number of carbons in straight chain the higher the volatility\n\n### **Chemical Properties of Alkanes**\n-   Combustion\n\t-   Alkanes are flammable\n\t-   Complete combustion (lots of oxygen present) produces carbon dioxide and water\n\t-   Incomplete combustion (limited oxygen present) produces carbon monoxide and water\n\n## **Alkenes**\n-   Alkenes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one double bond between 2 carbon atoms\n-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons\n-   C=C double bond\n-   The double bond is the functional group of the alkene homologous series\n-   **Hydrogen = 2*carbon**\n\n### **Naming Alkenes: Straight Chain**¬†\n-   Alkenes with carbon atoms arranged in a continuous straight line\n-   Retain the prefixes **Eth, Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct** for the parent compound\n-   Parent chain is the long chain containing the C=C\n-   Number the chain from the end that gives the C=C the lowest number\n-   Family suffix name: ene\n\n### **Naming Alkenes: Structural Isomerism**\n-   Alkenes containing 4+ carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, structural isomerism occurs\n-   e.g. C4 alkene C4H8 has 2 isomers\n-   Use the lower number of C where the double bond occurs for suffix n-ene\n-   The prefixes are still the same for alkanes  \n\n1.  Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule with the C=C, this is given the stem name n-ene\n2.  Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain that will give the C=C the lowest number\n3.  Name the side chains in the same way as with alkanes\n\n### **Geometrical Structural Isomers**\n\n-   There is no rotation possible around a double bond\n-   2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different\n-   Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond\n-   Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond\n\n## **Properties of Alkenes**\n-   Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the relatively instability of the double bond\n-   Breaking a carbon-carbon bond from a double bond between carbon atoms requires less energy than breaking a C-C bond\n-   The boiling and melting points of alkenes are generally slightly lower than alkanes with the same amounts of carbon atoms.\n-   The boiling point of straight-chain alkenes is more than branched-chain alkenes just as in alkanes\n-   Alkenes with 2-4 carbon atoms = gases at room temperature\n-   Alkenes with 5-17 carbon atoms = liquids at room temperature\n-   Viscosity of alkenes increases with increased carbon chain length\n-   Volatility of alkenes decreases with increased carbon chain length\n\n## **Alkynes**\n-   Alkynes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one triple bond between 2 carbon atoms\n-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons\n-   C‚ò∞C triple bond\n-   The triple bond is the functional group of the alkyne homologous series‚Äô\n-   Hydrogen = 2*carbon - 2\n\n### **Naming Alkynes: Straight chain**\n-   Alkynes with carbon atoms arranged in a continuous straight line\n-   Retain the prefixes **Eth, Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct** for the parent compound\n-   Parent compound is the longest chain containing the C‚ò∞C\n-   Number the chain from the end that gives the C‚ò∞C the lowest number\n-   Family name suffix: yne\n\n### **Properties of Alkynes**\n-   Ethyne, propyne and butyne = gases, C5-C12 = liquid\n-   Boiling points\n\t-   Compared to alkanes and alkenes, alkynes have a slightly higher boiling point\n-   Viscosity of alkynes increases with increased carbon chain length\n-   Volatility of alkynes decreases with increased carbon chain length\n\n## **Cycloalkanes**\n-   Rings of carbon atoms with distinguishing chemical properties = cycloalkanes\n-   Cycloalkanes only contain carbon-hydrogen bonds and carbon-carbon single bonds, but in cycloalkanes, the carbon atoms are joined in a ring\n-   The smallest cycloalkane is cyclopropane\n-   Hydrogen = 2*carbon\n\n### **Naming Cycloalkanes**\n-   Use the number of carbons in the ring to determine the prefix **Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct**\n-   Suffix = n-ane\n-   Place cyclo- in front\n\n## **Cycloalkenes**\n-   Hydrogen = 2*(carbon - number of double bonds)\n\n## **Naming Cycloalkenes**\n-   Use the number of carbons in the ring to determine the prefix **Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct**\n-   Suffix = ene¬†\n-   Place cyclo- in front\n\n## **Alcohols**\n-   Homologous group of carbon compounds containing the hydroxyl (-OH) group\n-   Methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc\n-   General formula Cn, H2n+1, OH\n\n# **Isomers**\n- Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula (i.e. same number and type of atoms) but in which the atoms are arranged in a different way\n- There are 2 main categories of isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism\n\n### **Structural Isomerisms**\n-   Different structural formulae\n-   Chain isomerism\n\t-   Carbon chain is arranged differently, e.g. different shape, L shape instead of chain, cross shape\n-   Positional isomerism\n\t-   Functional group is attached to a different carbon atom, e.g. 3-chloropentane, 2-chloropentane\n\t-   Also exists in alkenes with 4 or more carbon atoms\n-   Functional group isomerism\n\t-   Have different functional groups, so are members of different homologous series\n\n### **Stereoisomerism**\n-   Have same structural formula\n-   3d arrangement of atoms is different\n-   2 types\n-   Cis-trans isomerism\n-   Optical isomerism\n\n\t### **Cis-trans isomerism**\n\t-   Molecules can rotate freely around C-C covalent bonds, but not around C=C double bonds\n\t-   Leads to cis-trans isomerism, in which isomers differ in the arrangement of the groups attached to the carbons in the double bonds\n\t-   These isomers cannot be super imposed on each other because the arrangement of the methyl groups is different\n\t-   If an alkyl group or atom other than hydrogen is attached to each carbon then the atoms can be named either **cis** (on the same side) or **trans** (on the opposite side)\n\t\n\t**Limitations of Cis-Trans isomerism**\n\t-   In more complex organic compounds, in which multiple hydrogens have been substituted by different groups, isomers cannot be defined using the **cis-trans** notation\n\t-   Instead, a different system is used for these type of molecules: **E-Z notation**\n\n### **E-Z Notation**\n-   Used to identify stereoisomers that cannot be called cis or trans\n-   Isomers are identified as either E or Z depending on what ‚Äúpriority‚Äù is given to the groups attached to the carbon atoms in the double bond\n-   Priority of these groups is determined by a series of complex rules\n-   **E** represents the German word ‚Äúentgegen‚Äù(opposite) and corresponds to trans isomers\n-   The highest priority groups are on the opposite side of the double bond\n-   **Z** represents the German word ‚Äúzusammen‚Äù(together) and corresponds to cis isomers\n-   The highest priority groups are on the same side of the double bond\n\n### **Optical isomerism**\n-   A molecule can exist as 2 isomers that are non-superimposable, mirror images of each other, just like a left hand and right hand\n-   Optical isomers have the same physical properties but they rotate polarised light in opposite directions","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.527398064Z","tags":[]},"/10Literature/MetaphysicalPoetry":{"title":"Metaphysical Poetry","content":"\n[go back](10Subjects/10Literature.md)\n\n##

The equation for the alpha decay of uranium-238 is: $$^{238}_{92}U -\u003e^{234}_{90}Th+^4_2 He^{2+}+energy$$\nIn the decay process, the parent nucleus **238-92-U** has spontaneously emitted an alpha particle (‚ç∫) and has changed into a completely different element, **234-90-Th.** Thorium-234 is called the daughter nucleus. The energy released is mostly kinetic energy carried by the fast-moving alpha particle. When an atom changes into a different element, it is said to have undergone a **nuclear transmutation**. In nuclear transmutations, electric charge is conserved‚Äîseen as a conservation of atomic number In the example, 90+2 = 92. The number of nucleons¬† is also conserved; 234+4 = 238.\n\n## **Beta Decay**\n-   Beta particles are electrons\n-   Originated from **nucleus** of a radioactive atom¬†\n-   Not from electron cloud\n-   Can be written as:\n$$^0_{-1}e^{-}$$\n$$^0 _{-1}\\beta ^-$$\n  \n\n-   The atomic number of -1 indicates that it has a single negative charge\n-   Mass number of 0 indicates its mass is far less than a proton or neutron\n-   Beta decay occurs in nuclei where there is an imbalance of neutrons to protons\n-   Typically, if a light nucleus has too many neutrons to be stable, a neutron will spontaneously change into a proton\n- Ionising ability is medium\n\t- Since it is negatively charged, it is repelled by the electron cloud of other atoms\n\t- Experiences a large number of collisions, but expends less energy from them\n\t- Therefore less ionising\n-   Electron and a uncharged massless particle called an **antineutrino** are ejected to restore the nucleus to a more stable state\n- Antineutrino is symbolised as $\\overline{V}$ \n\n**Example**\nIsotopes of carbon: **C-12-6, C-13-6 and C-14-6**. Carbon-12 and 13 are both stable, but carbon 14 is unstable. It has more neutrons, and therefore undergoes a beta decay to be stable. In the process, one of the neutrons changes into a proton. As a result, the proton number increases to 7, and so the product is not carbon. Nitrogen-14 is formed. The nuclear equation for this decay is: $$^{14}_{6}C-\u003e {^{14}_{6}N}+{^0_{-1}e+ \\overline{V}+energy}$$The transformation taking place in the nucleus is: $$^1_0n-\u003e^1_0p+^0_{-1}e+ \\overline{V}$$\n-   n: neutrons\n-   p: protons\n-   e: beta particle\nOnce again, notice how in all these equations, the atomic and mass numbers are conserved. The antineutrino has no charge and has so little mass that both its atomic and mass numbers are 0\n\n### Beta Decay (Positrons)\n- A different form of beta decay occurs in atoms that have too many protons\n- A proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (Œ≤+). This is known as a Œ≤+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron\n- Positrons have the same properties as electrons, but their electrical charge is positive rather than negative. Positrons are an example of antimatter.\n\n**Example**\nThe radioactive decay of unstable nitrogen-12. There are 7 protons and 5 neutrons in the nucleus, and a proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (Œ≤+). This is known as a Œ≤+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron. The equation is: $${^{14}_{6}N}-\u003e^{14}_{6}C+{^0_{+1}e+ \\overline{V}+energy}$$\n\n### Gamma Decay\n- Generally, after a radioisotope has emitted an alpha/beta particle, the daughter nucleus holds an excess of energy\n- The protons and neutrons in the daughter nucleus then rearrange slightly and offload this excess energy by releasing gamma radiation (high-frequency electromagnetic radiation)\n- Ionising ability is low\n\t- Interact with matter infrequently when they collide directly with the nucleus or an electron\n\t- Low density of the atom makes this infrequent, therefore it cannot dislodge electrons as much as beta particles\n\t- Low ionisation ability\n- Gamma rays‚Äîlike all light‚Äîhave no mass and are uncharged\n- However, it contains a lot of energy\n- Symbol is: $$^0_0 \\gamma$$\n- Being a form of light, gamma rays travel at the speed of light\n- Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation/waves, and have the shortest wavelength\n- They are photons\n\n**Example:**\nA common example of a gamma ray emitter is iodine-131. Iodine-131 decays by beta and gamma radiation to form xenon-131. The equation for this is: $$^{131}_{53}I-\u003e{^{131}_{54}Xe+^0_{-1}e+^0_0 \\gamma}$$\n**These equations can also be written with $\\alpha,\\beta$ or $\\gamma$ written over the reaction arrow**\n\n|

Electromagnetic Waves\n-   Form of energy that emits in waves\n-   Transfers energy without transferring matter\n-   Can pass through vacuums\n-   Shorter the wavelength, higher the frequency\n-   This energy is mainly expressed as light, but can be expressed as heat or electricity\n-   Radiation can be emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves (gamma rays)\n![](images/Increasing%20Frequency%20(v).webp.png)\n\n\n## **Half Life**\n-   When a radioactive element decays, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time\n-   The time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to half its original amount is called its half-life\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.527398064Z","tags":[]},"/10Physics/NuclearPhysicsHumanEndeavours":{"title":"Nuclear Physics as a Human Endeavour","content":"\n[go back](10Subjects/10Physics.md)\n\n## Nuclear Power Stations\n\n### **Pros**\n-   Energy efficient\n-   Small land footprint\n-   Average nuclear power plant producing 2000 MW takes up a square mile of space\n-   Very powerful, energy wise\n-   Reliable\n-   Produce their maximum power output 93% of the time\n-   Very stable\n-   Produces no greenhouse gases\n### **Cons**\n-   Closely connected to nuclear weapon technology production/proliferation\n-   Dangerous to society\n-   Nuclear waste\n-   Extremely poisonous products\n-   Takes 10s of 1000s of years to stop being radioactive/poisonous\n-   Possibility of nuclear accidents\n-   Uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions\n-   Neutrons from fission reaction create another fission reaction\n-   Causes excess of energy in the form of heat\n-   Sometimes the heat is too much for the reactor to handle\n-   It melts, and radioactive waste is expelled\n-   Expensive to set up\n-   Uranium is expensive\n\n### **Nuclear Power Station Components**\n-   Fuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium\n-   Moderator: material that slows down neutrons\n\t-   Graphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide\n\t-   Heavy water is the best but is too expensive\n\t-   Water with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen\n\t-   Graphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen\n\t-   Ensures that neutron capture occurs\n\t-   When the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy\n-   Control rods: material that absorbs neutrons\n\t-   Boron steel or cadmium\n\t-   Ensures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission\n-   Coolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down\n\t-   e.g. water\n-   Radiation shield: thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%208.00.46%20pm.png)\n\n## **Uses of Radiation**\n### **Medical Tracers**\n-   Radioactive substance injected into the body\n-   Usually iodine, as it is absorbed by the thyroid gland\n-   They measure the gamma radiation emitted to track pathways or image the body\n-   Gamma is used as it is very penetrative (easier to measure from surface), and is less deadly in equal amounts (from the inside) than alpha and beta\n### **Industrial Tracers**\n-   Radioactive substance used in factories/industrial use\n-   Much the same concept as a medical tracer\n-   Injected into the system\n-   Finds leaks in systems, or tracks certain chemicals\n-   You can use a radioactive tracer if any escapes\n### **X-Rays**\n-   Electromagnetic waves are directed at the area of concern\n-   A material is placed behind the area\n-   The x-ray penetrates your body and into the area\n-   They image the shadows in the area to find out what‚Äôs wrong\n-   The bones absorb the x-ray, making this very useful, as we can see shadows, of the bone, or we can observe the brighter sections to view the muscles\n### **Radiometric/Carbon Dating**\n-   Radioactive dating uses the known half-life of an isotope and its composition to determine the age of a specimen\n-   The most common is carbon dating, but that‚Äôs only good for 40-50000 years\n-   When an archeological specimen is created in its time, it will mostly be carbon 14, but will slowly, over thousands of years, decay into nitrogen 14\n-   By measuring how much nitrogen/carbon 14 is present, we can very accurately determine the age of the specimen by comparing it to the carbon-12 levels of living things\n-   Carbon has a half life of 5730 years\n-   Since it‚Äôs only good for 40-50000 years, it‚Äôs good for measuring the age of human artefacts and similar things, but useless for determining things in the millions, e.g. dinosaur fossils, ancient rock formations\n-   For this, we use the decay of uranium into lead, which takes around 4.5 billion years\n-   By measuring how much lead is present, we can also determine the age of this specimen![](images/Contamination.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.527398064Z","tags":[]},"/10Subjects/10Biology":{"title":"Year 10 Biology Notes","content":"\n[go

Therefore, each element has different and unique emission and absorption spectra as the range of frequencies of light emitted are based on this unique set of discrete energy level differences\n\n# **Atomic Emission Spectra: used to identify elements in mixtures of high concentration**\n\n1.  The substance is vaporised, and put into a discharge tube\n2.  An electric discharge is passed through the tube. Electrons in the discharge excite other electrons by transferring kinetic energy during collision, then deflecting and losing energy\n3.  The electrons are **excited to a higher energy state** (as it has experienced an increase in energy exactly equal to E2 - E1)\n4.  Since they are unstable in their excited state, they will **transition** down to their **ground state**, and release energy in the form of radiation that has energy exactly equal to E2 - E1\n5.  Since **multiple transitions can occur within an atom**, a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength each is produced; thus when these emissions are captured an analysed in a line spectrometer; we only see specific light present\n6.  This produces a single stream of radiation, as all the wavelengths are travelling in the same direction. When the radiation is passed through a prism, the different frequencies/wavelengths are **separated** from each other, and are projected onto a black spectrum\n7.  It takes the form of coloured lines on a black background\n8.  Because all elements have a **unique spectra**, we can identify the element based on this\n\n# **Atomic Absorption Spectra: used to identify absorption of elements, or ability to retain heat**\n\n1.  White light (light of all frequencies) is passed through a substance in cool gas form\n2.  The substance‚Äôs electrons absorb the photons that are equal to their difference in energy levels and become **excited** (increase in energy exactly equal to E2-E1)\n3.  The electrons then transition back down to their **ground state**, as they are unstable in their normal state\n4.  However, the energy emitted (equal to E2-E1) d**oes not travel parallel** to its original direction. Therefore, they will not reach the spectroscope, and are **missing** from the spectrum when the light is separated\n5.  It takes the forms of black lines on the colour spectrum\n6.  Because all elements have a **unique spectra**, we can identify the element based on this\n\n# **Flame Test: used to detect primary metal ions**\n\n1.  Sample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame\n2.  As the substance is heated, its **electrons become excited**, as they gain energy, and transition to a higher energy state\n3.  The electrons are unstable in this state, so they quickly transition to their ground state. When this happens, it emits photons with energy equal to the difference in energy levels which correspond to specific wavelengths\n4.  Therefore, the **photons have specific wavelength**s. Higher energies mean smaller wavelengths, and vice versa. **Specific wavelengths** mean **specific colours** are **observed**\n5.  Since excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of different photons of different wavelengths can be emitted. Therefore, a **spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed**\n6.  As most non-metals emit EMR outside the visible spectrum, we cannot use the flame test to identify non-metal atoms present. Most metals produce some EMR in the visible spectrum that can be used to identify them\n\n**What can it be used for?**\n\n1.  Ionic salts: we can only use the flame test for simple ionic solids and metals because when heated, the metal ions and the anions separate and the metal ion produces emission that is within the visible spectrum\n\n**What can‚Äôt it be used for?**\n\n1.  Complex molecules:\n    1.  These molecules have a large number of energy levels that can overlap to produce new energy levels, and so, excitation and de-excitation within these molecules produce a large variety of EMR and so their emission is not characteristic\n    2.  Large majority produce EMR that is outside the visible spectrum, so it cannot be observed\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n1.  The salt‚Äôs metal cation may not be excited by the relatively low temperature of the flame, e.g., magnesium\n2.  Salt may not be completely excited, meaning only a part of the emission spectra is emitted, leading to a different colour being observed\n3.  If the material is a non-metal (e.g. ionic compound), it may not be (fully?) excited at low temperatures or may produce EMR outside the visible spectrum\n4.  Ethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour (orange flame)\n5.  Some elements have (very?) similar colours; this makes it difficult to distinguish between 2 different elements","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.527398064Z","tags":[]},"/11Chemistry/AtomicStructure":{"title":"Atomic Structure","content":"\n[Go Back](11Subjects/11Chemistry.md)\n\n# **John Dalton**\n\n**1803-08: Proposed ‚ÄúAtomic Theory of Matter‚Äú**\n\n1.  Matter (elements) is composed of small, **indivisible**, particles called ‚Äúatoms‚Äù\n2.  All atoms for a given element are identical (same shape, size, mass, chemical properties)\n3.  Atoms are not created, destroyed or changed into different types in a chemical reaction: a chemical reaction involves the rearrangement, combination or separation of atoms\n4.  Atoms combine in fixed proportions to form compounds\n5.  Atom is a sphere\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n1.  Atoms **are divisible**: they are made of smaller particles known as **subatomic particles**\n    \n2.  Not all atoms for a given element are identical: some elements have atoms that **differ** in **mass** and **density (different number of neutrons)**. These are known as **isotopes**.\n    \n3.  Dalton claimed that atoms for different elements are different in all respects: Proved wrong in certain cases: Argon and Calcium both have an AMU of 40: known as **isobars**\n    \n4.  Dalton also claimed that different elements combined in whole-number ratios to form compounds. Not observed in complex compounds, e.g. sugar (CHO )\n    \n    12\n    \n    22\n    \n    11\n    \n5.  This theory fails to explain the existence of allotropes: it does not account for differences in properties of charcoal, graphite, diamond\n    \n\n# **J.J. Thompson**\n\n## **1903: Discovered Electron, and proposed Plum Pudding Model**\n\n### **Cathode Ray Experiment**\n\n1.  A **high voltage** causes electrons to be discharged from the cathode to the anode. J.J. Thompson discovered the same cathode ray for all metals, i.e. same cathode ray was emitted regardless of material. He also discovered that metals exposed to cathode rays would become charged\n2.  Cathode rays were passed through an **electric** and **magnetic field**\n3.  First, it was passed through an **electric field only**. The cathode rays were noted to be deflected towards the **positive** side of the electric field\n4.  Then, it was passed through **both** an **electric field** and a **magnetic field** applied **alongside** the electric field. The cathode rays passed **straight through**\n5.  Thus, the cathode rays were affected by both an electric and magnetic field\n6.  Since he knew the magnitude of the fields, using physics, Thompson determined the mass of the particle to be 1/1000 AMU\n7.  Since light is not affected by charge/electrical fields, and the cathode rays deviated towards the positive plate, and all metals produced the same cathode ray:\n8.  Thompson stated that a cathode ray was a **beam of** **negatively charged particles with mass**, that was present in all matter(i.e. atom)\n\n### **Plum Pudding Model: Proposed due to findings of Cathode Ray Experiment**\n\n1.  Thompson knew that atoms were electrically neutral **and** contained particles of negative charge: therefore, they must contain equal amounts of positive charge\n2.  Therefore, Thompson suggested that an atom comprised of electrons spread within a region of uniform mass and charge\n3.  **Negative** particles **inside** a **positively-charged** sphere\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n1.  It is known that this is incorrect; electrons occupy fixed orbitals, and the positive charge is concentrated in the nucleus as protons\n2.  **Could not explain** the **findings** made by Ernest Rutherford‚Äôs **Gold Foil Experiment**\n\n# **Ernest Rutherford**\n\n## **1911: Discovered nucleus, protons, and that most of an atom is empty space**\n\n### **Gold Foil Experiment**\n\n1.  A lead block containing radioactive alpha emitters was used: this produced **alpha particles** that were targeted at a **zinc sulphide** screen\n2.  These alpha particles were directed to a very thin sheet of **gold** (only a few atoms wide)\n3.  When the alpha particles collided with the **zinc sulphide** screen, **flashes of light** were produced and the **impact positions** could be viewed through a **microscope**\n\n**Observations**\n\n1.  Most of the alpha particles passed straight the gold foil\n    1.  **Contradicts** the **Plum Pudding Model**, if it was true, a wall of spheres of positive charge would be formed, and **alpha particles** would have been **repelled**\n    2.  Therefore, since **most** alpha particles passed through the **gold foil**, an atom must comprise of **mostly empty space**\n2.  Some alpha particles were deflected in a minor way\n    1.  **Contradicts** the **Plum Pudding Model**, as it states that the entire atom is neutral due to the equal distribution of positive and negative charge; there is **no neutral region**\n    2.  Therefore, the repulsion is due to an electrical repulsion and in the context of the atom: There must be a positively charged region. **Rutherford** called this the **proton**\n    3.  Finally, since only a small amount of alpha particles were deflected, the positive charge must be concentrated to a **small volume** at the centre of the atom: i.e., the **nucleus**\n3.  Some alpha particles were deflected quite significantly (1 in 20 000)\n    1.  A significant deflection like this occurs only when there is a direct collision of 2 heavy charged particles; therefore, this deflection must be due to a direct collision with the positive region; this **reconfirmed** that the protons must be concentrated at the centre of the atom, i.e., the nucleus\n    2.  Therefore, deflection only occurs if the nuclear region has a **positive charge** and so the electrons must exist **separate** to the **protons** - Rutherford stated that the electrons must be orbiting **around** the nucleus\n\n### **Rutherford Model**\n\n1.  The atom comprises of mostly empty space occupied by very low mass negatively charged particles called electrons\n2.  The electrons orbit a very small (0.05% by volume) central region called the nucleus which is comprised of subatomic particles called protons\n3.  Protons are subatomic particles concentrated at the nucleus that comprise of the **majority** of an atom‚Äôs mass and a **positive charge**\n\n**Problems with the Rutherford Model**\n\n1.  It could not explain the stability of an atom because it doesn‚Äôt obey Maxwell‚Äôs law of electrodynamics\n    1.  An electron (an accelerating charge) should continuously emit radiation and gradually lose energy, so its distance from the nucleus should become shorter and finally fall into the nucleus. However, this never happens\n2.  The arrangement of electrons is not described at all\n3.  It cannot explain the atomic line-emission spectra\n4.  It does not have neutrons in its model\n\n# **Niels Bohr**\n\n## **Explained the orbitals of electrons, and the line emission spectra: 1913**\n\n**Context**\n\n1.  Scientists found that when an electric discharge is passed through a discharge tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, it emits some light\n2.  When this light is passed through a prism, it splits up into a set of 5 lines. This spectrum is called the line spectrum of hydrogen. This is known as the **line emission spectrum**. Scientists were unable to explain this\n\n### **Bohr‚Äôs Model: The Three Postulates**\n\n1.  **Fixed orbitals**: Electrons move in a circular orbit around the nucleus under the influence of the electrostatic attraction of the nucleus\n2.  **Angular momentum is quantised**\n    1.  Electrons occupy fixed energy levels and for these fixed energy levels electrons do not emit radiation as these orbits are stable (hence Maxwell‚Äôs Law)\n    2.  Energy levels are a specific distance from the centre of the nucleus, proportional to their energies\n3.  **Energy transitions**: Electrons can transition to higher or lower energy levels by emitting or absorbing fixed quantities of energy (photons)\n    1.  An electron can transition to a higher state by absorbing a photon with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n    2.  An electron can transition to a lower state by emitting a photon with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (initial and final)\n\n### **What Bohr‚Äôs Model tells us**\n\n1.  **Emission spectra**\n    1.  When an **electric discharge** is passed through a discharge tube, electrons that are found in that discharge transfer some kinetic energy during collision to the atoms‚Äô electrons\n    2.  The electron issued the atom is then **excited to a higher energy state**(as it has experienced an increase in energy exactly equal to E2 - E1) and the incident electron will decelerate and be deflected in another direction\n    3.  As electrons are **unstable** in the **higher transition state**, they will **transition down** to the **ground state**, thus releasing energy in the form of **radiation** that has an energy exactly equal to E2-E1\n    4.  As the ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù of the radiation (and therefore its ‚Äúcolour‚Äù) is **proportional to the energy** it has, **one specific** wavelength/frequency of light will be produced per transition\n    5.  Since **multiple transitions can occur within an atom**, a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength each is produced; thus when these emissions are captured an analysed in a line spectrometer; we only see specific light present\n2.  **Unique Spectra**: As the discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique to each atom, the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element. Therefore, each element has different and unique emission and absorption spectra as the range of frequencies of light emitted are based on this unique set of discrete energy level differences\n\n**Problems with Bohr‚Äôs Model**\n\n1.  **Multi-electron Atoms**\n    1.  Does not work for atoms with more than 1 electron in the valence shell, and it is not possible to calculate all the spectral lines of all other atoms, as this model still has classical components, e.g., electrostatic attraction, whereas Schrodinger‚Äôs model is explains this, and is Q.E.D.\n2.  **Relative Intensities of Spectral Lines**\n    1.  The spectral lines are not of equal intensity, but Bohr‚Äôs model cannot explain why some electron transition would be favoured, and thus some wavelength of light appeared more intense in the spectra\n3.  **Hyperfine Lines**\n    1.  Careful observations showed that there were other known lines (hyperfine lines) i.e., 2 bands contained in a single band, thus the energy levels of Bohr‚Äôs model must be split but the model cannot account for this\n4.  **Zeeman effect**\n    1.  When a gas is excited in a magnetic field, the emission spectrum shows a splitting of the spectral lines (Zeeman effect) . The Bohr model cannot account for this\n\n# **Sir James Chadwick**\n\n## **Discovered the Neutron: 1932**\n\n1.  Sir Chadwick determined that protons made only 1/2 the mass of the atom when he analysed Rutherford‚Äôs experimental data; specifically the extent and frequency of alpha particle deflIection\n2.  Thus, he believed that there was a hidden component to the atom that constituted its remaining mass (50%)\n\n### **Experiment and Results**\n\n1.  In 1932 it was discovered that Beryllium, when bombarded by alpha particles, emitted a very energetic stream of radiation, originally thought to be gamma\n2.  However, further investigation into its properties revealed contradictory results. Like gamma rays, they were extremely penetrating, and since they were not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, neutral\n3.  Sir Chadwick fired alpha particles at beryllium which emitted an unknown radiation. This radiation was then allowed to incident at paraffin (proton rich) causing paraffin to release protons\n4.  Using the equation of linear momentum, Chadwick determined that the radiation was a particle of mass 1 AMU (similar to protons) but with 0 electrical charge.

As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it\n\t- Some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to the silica gel than others so they lag behind the solvent\n\t\t- The more polar molecules have a stronger IMF between itself and the gel, thus it sticks more strongly, and lags\n\t- Eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance\n- The solvent (i.e. the mobile phase) is drawn up the stationary phase by capillary action\n\t- Adhesive forces are between molecules of different substances\n\t\t- Adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to stationary phase\n\t- Cohesive forces are between molecules of the same substance\n\t\t- Cohesion enables solvent molecules to bond to each other and move each other through stationary phase\n\t- Capillary action causes liquids to form a meniscus in a narrow glass tube.\n\n## TLC or Paper Chromatography?\n- TLC has a lot of advantages\n\t- Glass plate is rigid, not flexible like paper, so it is easy to control\n\t- After separation, the substances in the mixture can be recovered\n\t\t- The silica gel holding the separated substances is scraped of the glass plate and added to a solvent\n\t\t- The substance will dissolve and the silica gel can easily be removed by filtration\n\t\t- The glass plates can be re-coated with silica gel and be used over and over again\n\n## Retention Factor (Rf)\n- Ratio of the distance traveled of the solute to the solvent\n- Different pigments have different Rf values\n$$Rf=\\frac{Solute_{distance}}{Solvent_{distance}}$$\n- Greater Rf means it is more non-polar\n\n## UV and Locating Agents\n- Many substances are white or colourless, and so aren't visible on a TLC plate\n- One way of making colourless substances show up is to use UV light.\n- This usually works well for organic compounds\n- An alternative method is to use a chemical locating agent ‚Äì a chemical that reacts with the substance to form a coloured compound.\n\t- For example, when ninhydrin is exposed to an organic compound it stains it purple-brown.\n\n## Gas Chromatography\n- Used widely in many analytical laboratories, including forensic police labs, synthetic chemical labs, and drugs testing labs.\n- Suitable for low molecular weight samples\n- In paper and thin layer chromatography, the mobile phase is a liquid\n- However, as the name implies, the mobile phase in GC is an inert gas. \n- The stationary phase is usually a long thin tube of silica gel.\n- Like all forms of chromatography, GC uses a stationary phase to impede the movement of a mobile test substance.\n- Different substances are attracted to the matrix by different amounts, and therefore journey along it at different speeds.\n- In GC, the sample is injected into the machine, where it is vaporised. It is then washed over the matrix by an inert gas.\n- Some substances will be more attracted to the matrix than others.

between particles\n-   Liquid: stronger attraction between particles\n-   Solids: Very strong attraction between particles\n- Also known as Van Der Waal's forces\n\n## Dispersion Forces\n- Forces existing between 2 polar or non-polar molecules\n- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 oppositely charged temporary/induced dipoles\n- Electrons move randomly; thus dipoles are temporary, as their charges is based on these electrons, as their localisation is temporary\n- Molecules with dipoles can polarise other molecules and make them form temporary dipoles - these are

molecular formula but a different structural formula\n-   Structural isomers have:\n\t-   Different names\n\t-   Different shapes\n\t-   Different chemical properties\n\n\n\n## **Geometrical Structural Isomers**\n\n-   There is no rotation possible around a double bond\n-   2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different\n-   Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond\n-   Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond\n\n## ### **Structural Isomerisms**\n-   Different structural formulae\n-   Chain isomerism\n\t-   Carbon chain is arranged differently, e.g. different shape, L shape instead of chain, cross shape\n-   Positional isomerism\n\t-   Functional group is attached to a different carbon atom, e.g. 3-chloropentane, 2-chloropentane\n\t-   Also exists in alkenes with 4 or more carbon atoms\n-   Functional group isomerism\n\t-   Have different functional groups, so are members of different homologous series\n\n### **Stereoisomerism**\n-   Have same structural formula\n-   3d arrangement of atoms is different\n-   2 types\n-   Cis-trans isomerism\n-   Optical isomerism\n\n\t### **Cis-trans isomerism**\n\t-   Molecules can rotate freely around C-C covalent bonds, but not around C=C double bonds\n\t-   Leads to cis-trans isomerism, in which isomers differ in the arrangement of the groups attached to the carbons in the double bonds\n\t-   These isomers cannot be super imposed on each other because the arrangement of the methyl groups is different\n\t-   If an alkyl group or atom other than hydrogen is attached to each carbon then the atoms can be named either **cis** (on the same side) or **trans** (on the opposite side)\n\t\n\t**Limitations of Cis-Trans isomerism**\n\t-   In more complex organic compounds, in which multiple hydrogens have been substituted by different groups, isomers cannot be defined using the **cis-trans** notation\n\t-   Instead, a different system is used for these type of molecules: **E-Z notation**\n\n## **E-Z Notation**\n-   Used to identify stereoisomers that cannot be called cis or trans\n-   Isomers are identified as either E or Z depending on what ‚Äúpriority‚Äù is given to the groups attached to the carbon atoms in the double bond\n-   Priority of these groups is determined by a series of complex rules\n-   **E** represents the German word ‚Äúentgegen‚Äù(opposite) and corresponds to trans isomers\n-   The highest priority groups are on the opposite side of the double bond\n-   **Z** represents the German word ‚Äúzusammen‚Äù(together) and corresponds to cis isomers\n-   The highest priority groups are on the same side of the double bond\n\n## **Optical isomerism**\n-   A molecule can exist as 2 isomers that are non-superimposable, mirror images of each other, just like a left hand and right hand\n-   Optical isomers have the same physical properties but they rotate polarised light in opposite directions\n\n## Boiling Point with Isomers\n### **Van der Waal‚Äôs forces**\n-   Named after Dutch scientist J D Van der Waal who discovered them\n-   The forces are created by the constant movements of electrons in atoms of molecules at high speeds\n-   At any instant in time there is the likelihood that one side of the molecule has a greater proportion of electrons\n-   This is called a dipole, and causes the molecule to have positively and negatively charged ends\n-   A temporary dipole or imbalance of charge can attract the electron cloud from a neighbouring atom or molecule, e.g. slightly positive end attracts negatively charged electrons\n-   The temporary dipole induces an imbalance of charges in neighbouring molecules\n-   The strength of the VdW force is dependent on the size of the molecules or atoms\n-   As the size and molecular mass of the molecule increases so does the number of electrons, resulting in a greater imbalance of charge, and therefore a greater VdW attraction\n-   This is why boiling points increase as the number of carbon atoms increase in alkanes, more energy is

Law\n\n$$PV=nRT=k$$\n- The ideal gas law\n\t- P = pressure, in kPa\n\t\t- Newton/area\n\t\t- 1 atm (atmosphere) ~ 100 kPa\n\t- V = volume, in L\n\t- n = moles\n\t- R = universal gas constant\n\t\t-

pressure\n\t- 25 ÀöC, and 100 kPa\n\t- 1 mole of gas at STP takes up 22.7 L of space\n- Absolute 0: temperature at 0 Kelvins where movement of all particles stops\n\n## Gas Pressure\n- Gases consist of particles in constant random motion, spread a long ay apart\n- When gases collide with the walls of their container, each collision exerts a force. \n- This causes a pressure to be exerted on the walls of the container, i.e. **a force per unit area**\n- Measured in Pascals, 1 Pa = $1 \\frac{N}{m^2}$\n- We also measure pressure in atmospheres, where 1 atm = 101.3 kPa\n\n## Kinetic Theory\n- The kinetic theory of gases links the macroscopic behaviour of a gas with its microscopic behaviour\n- **In macroscopic terms**,  a gas is a phase of matter that has a fixed mass and whose volume is equal to the volume of its container. \n\t- The gas exerts pressure on the walls of the container\n- **In microscopic terms**, a gas is a collection of many particles that collide with each other and with the container walls\n- The kinetic theory relates the pressure exerted by a gas to the motion of its particles\n- The kinetic theory of gases was developed from experimental evidence to explain the similar behaviours of all gases\n- Mathematical relationships between pressure, volume, moles and temperature have been derived for an **ideal gas**, that is one that obeys all the equations perfectly\n- There is no such thing as an ideal gas - no real gases behave exactlly as the laws describe.\n\t- However, under normal conditions, almost all gases follow the ideal gas model very closely\n- Real gases deviate most from ideal gas behaviour at very low temperatures and very high pressures\n- Gases with small particles like H and He follow the ideal gas laws most closely\n\t- Smaller particles means less collisions\n\n### Ideal Gas assumptions\n- When describing an ideal gas, the following assumptions are made\n1. The motion of all particles is random\n2. All particles travel in straight lines\n3. intermolecular (electrostatic) and gravitational forces are negligible\n4. All particles of a particular gas are identical and perfect spheres\n5. Internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic\n6. All collisions between particles and the walls of the container are completely elastic (no loss of kinetic energy)\n7. Particles take up negligible volume (pressure is due to mobility)\n8. Newton's Laws of Motion apply\n\t1. An object travelling at a constant velocity, or at rest, will remain at that constant velocity or at rest, unless acted upon by an external force. i.e., inertia\n\t2. Force is equal to mass times acceleration\n\t3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\n\n## Kinetic Energy and Temperature\n- An important aspect of kinetic theory is that temperature is related to average kinetic energy of the particles\n- However there is a range of kinetic energy values for the particles at any particular temperature - some move faster, and some move slower than the average\n- The **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** describes the distribution of kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature\n\t- y axis is number of particles in a sample\n\t- x axis is energy\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-08%20at%2012.58.49%20pm.png)\n- At a given temperature, particles of all gases have the same distribution of kinetic energies, no matter what size their particles are. \n- The relationship between kinetic energy, mass, and velocity is $e = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$\n- This means that particles with a greater mass with have a lower average velocity, and vice versa\n\n## Measuring Temperature\n- The **absolute** or **thermodynamic scale of temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. \n- Measured in degrees **Kelvin** (K)\n- When temperature is measured in Kelvin, the temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles\n- Absolute temperature starts at **absolute zero** - the theoretical lowest possible temperature, at which point the particles would have no kinetic energy\n- The absolute scale has units of the same magnitude as the celsius scale\n- Converting to and from Kelvin and degrees Celsius\n$$T(K)=T(ÀöC)+273.15$$\n$$T(ÀöC)=T(K)-273.15$$\n\n## Applying Kinetic Theory\n- Kinetic theory can be used to explain many important properties of gases\n1. Gases diffuse quickly because gas particles move rapidly and randomly through the large amount of empty space between particles to spread out\n2. Gases are easily compressed due to the large amount of empty space between particles\n3. Gases spread out to fill a container due to the negligible forces of attraction between particles\n4. Gases exert pressure because the particles move randomly/rapidly and collide with the interior surfaces of the container\n5. Gases have low densities due to the large amount of space between particles\n\n### Why increasing temperature increases the pressure of gas in a sealed vessel\n- Increased average kinetic energy of gas particles\n- Increases force of collisions on walls of the container\n- Increased velocity/speed of particles\n- Increases frequency of collisions will walls of container\n\n## Molar Volumes of Gases\n- If the temperature and pressure are fixed at convenient standard values, the molar volume of a gas can be determined\n- At standard temperature and pressure (273.15 K andd 100 kPa, 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.71 L. This is the molar volume)","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Chemistry/MassSpectrometry":{"title":"Mass Spectrometry","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Chemistry.md)\n\n## Relative Atomic Mass\n- **In this context:** weighted average of all isotopes occurring naturally of an element, relative to $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a Carbon-12 atom in its ground state\n- We use this when determining composition of elements from mass spectrometry \n- Determined from mass spectrums\n- Calculated as $$Ar(X)=\\frac{(\\% a \\times m(A))+(\\% b \\times m(B))...(\\% z \\times m(Z))}{100}$$\n- Where $\\%a$ is percentage abundance of isotope A.

The sample, usually in a aqueous or organic solution, is vaporised by a heater\n2. **Ionisation**: Sample is bombarded by high-energy electrons that have enough energy to displace electrons off the atom, turning them into cations.\n3. **Acceleration**: The ions are accelerated through charged plates\n4. **Deflection**: The ions are deflected by an magnetic field. The degree to which it is deflected depends on its speed, mass and charge\n\t1. **Mass**: Heavier ions will move more slowly, and hence be deflected less, and vice versa\n\t2. **Charge**: Ions with more charge are deflected more, as they are affected more by the magnetic field due to their greater charge\n5. **Detection**: The number of particles and the amount of deflection is measured. A mass spectrum is produced from this.\n\t1. Mass-to-charge ratio is measured (m/z). Since the charge of cation formed in the mass spectrometer is almost always +1, the mass-to-charge ratio of a cation is usually equal to the mass of the cation.

This means they can form ion ‚Äì dipole forces with water, and so are usually very soluble\n\n## Solubility of ionic substances\n- All ionic substances are soluble to some extent, so we categorise substances by the concentration of a saturated solution at 25Àö C.¬†\n- A substance is described as soluble if a saturated solution is 0.1 mol L-1 or higher.\n- A substance is described as slightly soluble if a saturated solution is 0.01 mol $L^{-1}$ to 0.1 mol $L^{-1}$.¬†\n- A substance is described as insoluble if a saturated solution is below 0.01 mol L-1.\n\n![](images/SolubilityDependency.png)\n\n# Precipitation\n\n## Precipitation Reactions\n- An insoluble solid that forms during an aqueous reaction is called a precipitate. \n- A reaction which forms a precipitate is called a precipitation reaction\n- The limewater test for carbon dioxide is a precipitation reaction\n\t- Limewater is actually a dilute solution of calcium hydroxide\n\t- The calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate, which is insoluble in water\n\n### Uses of Precipitation Reactions\n- Most precipitation reactions are very fast reactions that occur between ions.\n- This makes them very useful for identifying specific ions based on the type of precipitate formed.\n- Precipitation reactions have a number of other uses:\n\t- Production of coloured pigments for paints and dyes\n\t- Removal of toxic chemicals from water\n\t- Separation of reaction products.\n\n### Spectator Ions\n- In ionic precipitation reactions there are often ions that are not involved in the reaction. These are known as spectator ions.\n- The spectator ions are easily identified using the ionic equation, where they are the ions that don't change their state of matter, or don't participate in the reaction\n- You should always write net ionic equations, omitting spectator ions, in this course.\n\n### Identifying Positive Ions\n- Many metal ions can be identified by flame tests\n- However, precipitation reactions can also be used to identify positive ions, as many metals form hydroxide precipitates with characteristic colours\n\n### Identifying negative ions: Halides\n- Formed from group 17 elements, the halogens\n- Detected using silver nitrate solutions\n- Colourless ions in a solution\n- $I^-,Cl^-,Br^-$ \n- The different silver halide precipitates can be distinguished by their differing colours\n\t- Chloride: white AgCl precipitate\n\t- Bromide: cream AgBr precipitate\n\t- Iodide: yellow AgI precipitate\n\n\n### Isolating the Precipitate\n- Precipitate from a precipitation reaction can be separated from the reaction mixture by filtration\n- A Buchner funnel and flask can be used to accelerate the process\n\t- This apparatus uses a vacuum pump to draw the mixture through the filter\n\t- The filtrate is finally washed and dried\n\n# More Solubility\n\n## Solubility\n- Concentration of a saturated solution\n- **Saturated**: Solution where no more solute will dissolve at the given temperature\n- **Unsaturated**: Less solute than needed to make a saturated solution. Most solutions we use will be unsaturated\n- **Supersaturated**: Unstable solution, usually formed as a saturated solution curves down. If it is disturbed, it will crystallise, forming crystals of solute, and leave a saturated solution\n- **Solubility**: Mass of a substance that will dissolve in 100 g of water at 25Àö C\n\t- Measured in g/100g\n- The solubility of a substance depends on the temperature of the solvent\n\n### Solubility Curves\n- Solubility curves show the solubility of substances as temperature changes\n- Generally, the solubility of ionic solids increases with temperature\n\t- There is more energy to overcome bonding in the solid\n\n### Saturation and Crystallisation\n- Solutions become supersaturated when they contain more solute than they would normally be able to dissolve\n- This can happen when a saturated solution is cooled, or another change in conditions occurs that causes solubility to decrease\n- The solute will stay in solution until a ‚Äòseed‚Äô crystal is added. \n- This causes it to crystallise out of the solution very quickly.\n- When it does this, it gives out heat energy.\n\n### Solubility of Gases\n- Many gases are soluble in water. \n\t- For example, fish can breathe because of the oxygen dissolved in water.\n- Solubility of gases in water is often low, as most gases are not very polar. More polar gases are more soluble, in general.\n- As temperature increases, solubility of gases decreases\n\t- This is because the gases have more kinetic energy, which increases motion and breaks the IMF between the gases and the solvent, causing them to escape the solution\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Chemistry/Stoichiometry":{"title":"Stoichiometry","content":"\n#ongoing \n\n[go back](11Subjects/11Chemistry.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Chemistry/VSEPR":{"title":"VSEPR - Valence Shell Electron Repulsion Theory","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Chemistry.md)\n\n- VSEPR model can predict the structure of most molecules and polyatomic ions in which the central atom is a non-metal\n- Also works for some structures in which the central atom is a metal\n- VSEPR builds on Lewis Electron Dot Structures\n- Lewis structures alone predict only connectivity while the Lewis structure and VSEPR together can predict the geometry of each atom in a molecule\n\n### Key Concepts\n1.

This is basically what a catalyst does.\n\n- Catalysts provide alternative pathways that use less activation energy\n- They are not consumed in the reaction \n\n## Internal Energy\n- The molecules within a body all possess kinetic energy ($E_k$)\n\t- This is the energy due to their random motion\n- The molecules also contain potential energy($E_p$), due to chemical bonds holding them together and the bonds within their nuclei\n- The sum of all these molecular kinetic and potential energies represents the body's internal energy (U)\n$$U = E_k + E_p$$\n### Temperature and Heat\n- The temperature of a body is a measure of the kinetic energy of its molecules\n\t- Temperature indicates in which direction heat will flow when 2 bodies are placed close together\n- Thermal energy is the component of a body's internal energy due to its temperature\n\t- Thermal energy can be supplied to a body by heating it\n- Heat is the thermal energy transferred from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature, due solely to the temperature difference.\n\t- Measured in Joules, **not** ÀöC or K\n- Once bodies are at the same temperature, there is no net flow of thermal energy; the bodies are in thermal equilibrium\n\n\n## Enthalpy (once again!)\n- Enthalpy (H) is a measure of the energy stored in (or heat content of) a system\n- Cannot be measured directly\n\t- We can calculate enthalpy change instead\n- Always quoted at constant pressure\n- During reactions, the enthalpy of the reactants and the products is not the same\n- This results in energy being either given out or taken in during the reaction\n- This energy is the enthalpy change, $\\Delta H$\n$$\\Delta H =mc \\Delta T$$\n- c = specific heat capacity (usually of water)\n- m = mass (grams)\n- $\\Delta T$ = change in temperature (kelvin)","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/CircularFlowofIncome":{"title":"The Circular Flow of Income","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n- Macroeconomic model that describes the **flow of resources, goods and services, and income between the parts of the economy**\n- The model divides the economy into its important sectors\n\t- Households\n\t- Firms\n\t- The financial sector\n\t- Government\n\t- Overseas (foreign) sector\n- Shows that in any given time period, the value of output produced in an economy is equal to the total income generated in producing that output, which is equal to the expenditures made to purchase that output\n- $S+T+M=I+G+X$\n![](images/Five_Sector_Circular_Flow_of_Income_Model.jpg)\n\n- Injections: inflows of money into the circular flow of income\n- Withdrawals: Outflows of money out of the circular flow of income","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/Demand":{"title":"The Theory of Demand","content":"\n\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n## Markets\n\n-   Where Buyers and Sellers meet in order to exchange money for goods\n    -   They do not always meet in person\n-   Goods can be bought by consumers and sold by suppliers in online markets, e.g., Amazon\n-   Amount of money a consumer pays the supplier in exchange for a good/service is called the ********price*********\n-   There are markets for the factors of production\n-   Labour is needed by producers to make goods\n-   The producers are the buyers of labour and individual people are the sellers of their own labour\n\n### Product Markets\n\n-   Product markets deal with the buying/selling of goods and services\n-   Consumers represent the demand side of the market, while producers/firms represent the supply side\n-   Firms produce goods and services and sell them to households (consumers)\n\n### Factor Markets\n\n-   Deal in the buying and selling for factors of production or resources\n    -   E.g., labour market\n-   In a factor market, households sell their resources to firms\n-   Households represent the supply side of the market\n-   Firms represent the demand side\n\n****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Markets can also be classified according to the intensity of competition in the market****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n### Competitive Markets\n\n-   Large number of buyers and sellers\n-   Firms are price takers (no power over price), must take price established by market\n-   Very similar (homogenous) products\n-   Easy entry into market (no barriers to entry or exit)\n-   Price is determined by the interaction between buyers and sellers\n-   No individual buyer or seller can influence the market price\n    -   No market power\n\n### Imperfect Market\n\n-   Not competitive\n-   A.k.a. non-competitive market\n-   Small number of firms\n-   Product differentiation\n-   Firms are price setters, can set their own price\n    -   They have market power\n-   Entry into market is restricted (barriers to entry), makes it harder to have competition\n-   E.g. Mobile Phones, Water Corporation\n-   Monopoly, Oligopoly\n    -   Monopoly: One seller or producer is the sole supplier of a good/service in a market\n    -   Oligopoly: Small number of firms, none of which can keep the others from having significant influence. **I.e.**, a few sellers/producers are the sole suppliers of a good/service in a market\n-   Firms try to make their products look ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù in their consumer‚Äôs eyes\n\n# Demand\n\n-   Amount of a good/service consumers are willing and able to buy in a given period of time at a given price, ceteris paribus\n    -   Ceteris paribus: other things remaining constant\n-   A.k.a. **effective demand**\n-   _**Law of Demand:**_ Quantity demanded of a product is inversely related to its price, in a given period of time, ceteris paribus\n-   ********************************Individual Demand:************************************ Demand for a good or service by an individual consumer\n-   **Market Demand:** Sum of the individual demand for a good or service by all of the consumers in the market\n\n![](images/factors.png)\n![](images/non%20price.png)\n**********Non-Price Factors affecting Ability and Willingness to buy**********\n\n1.

  E.g., cheaper alternatives, like flying with JetStar instead of Singapore Airlines\n-   Demand for the good varies inversely with income\n-   As income increases, consumers switch to more expensive alternatives, so the demand for the inferior good falls\n-   Relative to wants\n-   Increase in income leads to a leftward shift in the demand curve, and vice versa\n-   When income changes, demand will change in the opposite direction\n\n### Changes in Consumer Tastes and Preferences\n\n-   The more desirable a good is to consumers, the higher the demand, and vice versa\n-   Tastes and preferences are affected by advertisements, pop star appeal, age, peers, etc\n    -

Mention the effect a shortage or surplus has on price\n    1.  ‚ÄúShortage creates an upward pressure on price‚Äù\n    2.  ‚ÄúSurplus creates a downward pressure on price‚Äù\n3.  Mention how consumers react to shortage/surplus and the effect a change on price has in quantity demanded\n    1.  In a shortage, consumers offer more for their wants (demand increases), while producers notice this (supply increases) and increase their prices. This decreases quantity demanded and increases quantity supplied\n    2.  In a surplus, consumers offer less for their wants (demand decreases), while producers notice this (supply decreases) and decrease their prices. This increases quantity demanded and decreases quantity supplied\n4.  Mention how shortage/surplus will be eliminated\n    1.  Quantity demanded will continue to decrease and quantity supplied will continue to increase until the shortage is eliminated\n    2.  Quantity demanded will continue to increase and quantity supplied will continue to decrease until the surplus is eliminated\n5.  Mention the final equilibrium point and final effect on equilibrium price and quantity\n    1.  Final equilibrium point is at $E_2$. Price has increased from $P_0$ to $P_1$ and quantity has increased from $Q_0$ to $P_1$\n    2.  Final equilibrium point is at $E_2$. Price has decreased from $P_0$ to $P_1$ and quantity has decreased from $Q_0$ to $P_1$\n\n## Changes in Equilibrium\n|                    | Œî in Equilibrium |              |\n| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |\n| **Causes**         | **Price**        | **Quantity** |\n| Increase in DD, cp | Increases        | Increases    |\n| Decrease in DD, cp | Decreases        | Decreases    |\n| Increase in SS, cp | Decreases        | Increases    |\n| Decrease in SS, cp | Increases        | Decreases             |\n\n### Fall in Demand and Supply\n\n|                    | Œî in Equilibrium |              |\n| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |\n| **Causes**         | **Price**        | **Quantity** |\n| Decrease in DD, cp | Decreases        | Decreases    |\n| Decrease in SS, cp | Increases        | Decreases    |\n| Final Outcome      | Unknown          | Decreases    |\n\n-   Price increases if $Decrease_{DD}\u003cDecrease_{SS}$\n-   Price decreases if $Decrease_{DD}\u003eDecrease_{SS}$\n-   Price is the same if $Decrease_{DD}=Decrease_{SS}$\n\n### Fall in Demand but Rise in Supply\n|                    | Œî in Equilibrium |              |\n| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |\n| **Causes**         | **Price**        | **Quantity** |\n| Decrease in DD, cp | Decreases        | Decreases    |\n| Increase in SS, cp | Decreases        | Increases    |\n| Final Outcome      | Decreases        | Unknown      |\n\n-   Quantity increases if $Decrease_{DD}\u003cIncrease_{SS}$\n-   Quantity decreases if $Decrease_{DD}\u003eIncrease_{SS}$\n-   Quantity is the same if $Decrease_{DD}=Increase_{SS}$\n\n### Rise in Demand but Fall in Supply\n|                    | Œî in Equilibrium |              |\n| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |\n| **Causes**         | **Price**        | **Quantity** |\n| Increase in DD, cp | Increases        | Increases    |\n| Decrease in SS, cp | Increases        | Decreases    |\n| Final Outcome      | Increases        | Unknown      |\n\n-   Quantity increases if $Increase_{DD}\u003eDecrease_{SS}$\n-   Quantity decreases if $Increase_{DD}\u003cDecrease_{SS}$\n-   Quantity is the same if $Increase_{DD}=Decrease_{SS}$","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/MarketEfficiency":{"title":"Market Efficiency","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n**Consumer Surplus:** Highest price consumers are willing to pay for a good **********minus********** the price actually paid\n\n-   Area **below** demand curve and **********above********** price line\n\n**************Producer Surplus:****************** Price received by firms for selling their good **minus** the lowest price that they are willing to accept to produce the good\n\n-   Area **above** supply curve and **below** price line\n\n**Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus = Total Surplus**\n\n-   Total surplus reflects society‚Äôs welfare\n-   One of the key concerns of economics: Maximise **TS**\n-   **Allocative efficiency achieved when TS is maximised**\n\nDeadweight loss: Area between consumer and producer surplus, and market equilibrium\n- Difference in production and consumption of any given product or service including government tax\n- ","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.531398029Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/MarketPower":{"title":"Market Power","content":"#ongoing \n\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n- Market power is the ability of a business to insulate itself from competition\n- It also refers to the ability of a firm (or group of firms) to raise and maintain price above the level that would prevail under competition; this is referred to as market or monopoly power\n- The exercise of market power leads to reduced output and loss of economic welfare\n\n## Competitive Market\n- Competition is generally understood to be a process in which rivals compete in order to achieve some objective.\n- Competition in microeconomics occurs when there are many buyers and sellers acting independently, so that no one has the ability to influence the price at which a product is sold in the market.\n- This should be contrasted with market power, also known as monopoly power, which refers to the control that a seller may have over the price of the product it sells. \n- The greater the market power, the greater is the control over price. \n- On the other hand, the greater the degree of competition between sellers, the smaller their market power, and the weaker is their control over the price.\n\n## Imperfect Markets\n- A competitive market is characterised by a large number of small firms free entry and exit and very little product differentiation. \n- When one or more of these conditions is NOT MET - the market is said to be ‚Äòimperfect‚Äô \n- An imperfect market exists when: \n\t1. There are relatively small number of firms \n\t2. Firms have market power \n\t3. Firms use product differentiation \n\t4. Barriers to entry are used to restrict competition\n- The best examples of imperfect competition are monopoly and oligopoly markets. \n- A monopoly is a market with just one firm\n\t- Synergy and Australia Post are government regulated monopolies.\n- An oligopoly is a market with a few large dominant firms\n\t- Coles and Woolworths dominate the grocery market in Australia\n\n### Monopoly\n- Monopoly is a type of market structure where there is \n\t- A single firm dominating the market for a product, and\n\t- Where high barriers to entry (factors making it difficult for other firms to enter the industry) ensure that the monopoly position of the single seller can be preserved.\n- Monopoly power, also known as market power, refers to the ability of a firm or a group of firms to control the price of the product they sell. \n- Monopoly power can be exercised not only by monopolies, but also by firms in oligopolies, where there are a few large sellers.\n- Monopoly power is considered to be socially undesirable because it leads to:\n\t- A welfare loss, as social surplus is less than maximum\n\t- Allocative inefficiency - there is an under-allocation of resources to the good \n\t- Lower output and a higher price of the industry than the output and price of a more competitive market\n\n### Imperfect Markets: Barriers to Entry\n- Barriers to entry are an important feature of imperfect markets. \n- A barrier to entry is anything that restricts or blocks the entry of new firms into an industry or market. \n- They may include government regulation, patents, technology barriers, startup costs and licensing requirements.\n- Examples of entry barriers:\n\t- Controlling a scarce resource ‚Äì if a mining company secured the only diamond mine in the country, it would have sole rights to mine the gems. \n\t- A government licence granting a legal monopoly e.g. Australia Post \n\t- A technological advantage ‚Äì e.g. Microsoft has considerable market power because it supplies the operating system used in most computers. \n\t- A patent on an invention gives protection from competition (up  to 17 years in Australia) eg pharmaceutical firms\n\t- Extensive product differentiation, brand proliferation, large advertising budget, controlling retail outlets. \n\t- Economies of scale ‚Äì only a few firms can compete in the market because of the large set up costs \n\t\t- Economies of scale: Cost advantages companies experience when production becomes efficient, as costs can be spread over a larger amount of goods.\n\t- Collusive behaviour ‚Äì when firms agree to share markets, to fix prices or quantities or to otherwise seek to reduce competition and / or prevent new firms entering the market\n\n## Market Power\n- In an imperfect market, such as a monopoly or oligopoly, firms can use their market power to ‚Äòexploit‚Äô the market. \n- A firm has market power if it can affect the market price by varying its output. \n- Monopoly and oligopoly firms have substantial market power because they operate in markets with little effective competition ‚Äì Hence, firms with market power will attempt to profit maximise. \n- Their private interest will not necessarily coincide with society's interest and therefore the socially optimal level of output in unlikely to be produced. \n- This will result in higher prices and reduced output, decreasing economic welfare for society\n\n\u003e [!note]+ Market Power -  Barriers to Entry\n\u003e - The figure illustrates the effects of market power on price and quantity. \n\u003e - A competitive market will produce where demand equals supply. \n\u003e   The equilibrium price (Pe) and quantity (Qe) is efficient. \n\u003e - At the equilibrium, total surplus (the sum of consumers and producer surplus) is maximised.\n\u003e - CS + PS = Total Surplus maximised\n\u003e   ![](images/marketpower.png)\n\n\u003e [!note]+  Market Power -  Barriers to Entry 2\n\u003e - The figure below shows the effect of market power. \n\u003e - In this case the monopolist reduces output to Q1 in order to increase price to P1. \n\u003e - Notice that the consumers are now worse off ‚Äì they pay a higher price and consume a lower quantity. Consumer surplus decreases. \n\u003e - The monopoly on the other hand gains ‚Äì producer surplus (Revenue and possibly profit) increases.\n\u003e - But society is now worse off because total surplus decreases by the area DWL. \n\u003e - There is deadweight loss in economic welfare because the market has been restricted. \n\u003e - This is the classic case against monopoly and why monopolies and oligopolies are criticised for being inefficient. \n\u003e - Most countries now have government legislation which promotes a competitive business environment and tries to prevent firms with market power from exploiting the market.\n\u003e   ![](images/marketpower2.png)\n\n### Anti-competitive Behaviour\n- Competition provides the spur for businesses to improve their performance, develop new products and respond to changing circumstances. \n- Competition also offers the promise of lower prices and improved choice for consumers and greater efficiency, higher economic growth and increased employment opportunities.\n- Firms with market power have the incentive to reduce competition ‚Äì by either reducing price competition or by reducing he number of firms competing in the market. \n- The term anti-competitive behaviour refers to any agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and thereby remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve. \n- Any agreement between firms in an industry to fix prices to divide the market, or to prevent the entry of new. \n- Business practices that try to reduce competition will result in market failure and will lead to a deadweight loss.\n ![](images/reducingcompetition.png)\n\n## Government Policy\n- Market Power is prominent in imperfect markets such as monopoly and Oligopoly markets. \n- Market power is inefficient because it reduces competition and decreases total surplus \n- Government policy to address market power includes regulation/ deregulation as well as specific legislation. \n- An example of government legislation in Australia that attempts to prevent market power is the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.\n\t- This Act is administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and contains rules against anti competitive conduct to ensure that there is fair and effective competition within Australia. \n\t- The Act also contains consumer protection rules, known as the Australian Consumer Law, which businesses must abide by in their dealing with consumers. \n\t- The role of the ACCC is to protect, strengthen and supplement the way competition works in Australia markets and industries to improv efficiency of the economy and to increase the welfare of Australians.\n\t- This means that the ACCC tries to ensure that the benefits of increased competition flow through to consumers in the form of lower prices and better service. \n\t- It does this prohibiting anti-competitive conduct by firms with market power such as price fixing and collusion. \n\t- Listed below are some examples of business practices in Australia that are against the Law because they limit or prevent competition.\n- Cartels: A cartel exists when firms agree to act or collude together instead of competition with each other. \n\t- Typical cartel behavior includes price fixing and market sharing. \n- Misuse or market power: A business that has a substantial degree of power in a market (eg monopoly) is prohibited from taking advantage of that power for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor or preventing the entry of a firm into any market. \n- Exclusive dealing: this occurs when one firm trading with another imposes some restrictions on the others freedom to choose with whom , in what or where they deal. \n\t- Most types of exclusive dealing are against the law only when they substantially lessen competition.\n- Resale price maintenance: Suppliers manufactures and wholesalers are prohibited from specifying a minimum price below which goods or services may not be resold or advertised for resale. \n\t- A supplier may recommend a resale price for goods provided that it is a recommended price only. \n- Predatory pricing: this occurs when a company with substantial market power sets its prices at a sufficiently low level with the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor or preventing the entry of a competitor into that or any other market, \n- Collective boycotts: This occurs when a group of competitors agree not to acquire goods or services from, or not to supply goods or services to, a business with whom the group is negotiating , unless the business accepts the terms and conditions offered by the group.\n- Mergers and acquisitions: Mergers may be deemed to be in the public interest if they lead to benefits for consumers. \n\t- However, if they have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market then they are prohibited.","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/PED":{"title":"Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n- Measures

Negative Production Externalities\n\t2. Negative Consumption Externalities\n\t3. Positive Production Externalities\n\t4. Positive Consumption Externalities\n- Marginal External Cost (MEC):  Additional cost incurred by third parties who are not involved in the consumption and production of additional unit of the good\n- Marginal Social Cost (MSC): MPC + MEC; Additional costs incurred by society..... additional unit of the good\n- Marginal External Benefit (MEB): Additional benefit enjoyed by the third parties who are not involved in the consumption and production of additional unit of the good\n- Marginal Social Benefit (MSB): MPB + MEB, Additional benefit accrued by society ... for additional units of the good\n- **When MSB=MSC, social welfare is at a maximum**\n\n## Negative Externalities\n- In general, negative externalities, whether these arise from production or consumption activities, lead to allocative inefficiency arising from an overallocation of resources to the good and to its over-provision.\n### Negative Production Externalities\n- Negative externalities of production refer to external costs created by producers\n- The problem of environmental pollution, created as a side-effect of production activities, is very commonly analysed as a negative production externalities \n\n\u003e[!example]- Cement factory\n\u003e\n\u003eConsider a cement factory that emits smoke into the air and disposes its waste by dumping it into the ocean. There is a production externality, because over and above the firm‚Äôs private costs of production, there are additional costs that spill over onto society due to the polluted air and ocean, with negative consequences for the local inhabitants, swimmers, sea life, the fishing industry and the marine ecosystem. This is shown in the Figure, where the supply curve, S = MPC, reflects the firm‚Äôs private costs of production, and the marginal social cost curve given by MSC represents the full cost to society of producing cement.![](images/negativeproductionexternality.png)\n\u003e\n\u003eFor each level of output, Q, social costs of producing cement given by MSC are greater than the firm‚Äôs private costs. The vertical difference between MSC and MPC represents the external costs. Since the externality involves only production (the supply curve), the demand curve represents both marginal private benefits and marginal social benefits. The Figure illustrates a general point that you should keep in mind whenever you examine (or draw) an externality diagram: the free market outcome is determined by the intersection of MPB and MPC, resulting in quantity $Q_m$ and price $P_m$. The social optimum (or ‚Äòbest‚Äô) outcome is given by the intersection of MSB with MSC, which determines quantity $Q_{opt}$ and price $P_{opt}$.\n\n\u003e [!info]- Welfare Loss\n\u003e - Whenever there is an externality, there is a welfare (deadweight) loss, involving a reduction in social benefits, due to the misallocation of resources.\n\u003e - In the Figure, the shaded area represents the welfare loss arising from the negative production externality.\n\u003e - For all units of output greater than $Q_{opt}$, MSC \u003e MSB, meaning that society would be better off if less were produced. ![](images/welfareloss.png)\n\u003e - The welfare loss is equal to the difference between MSC and MSB for the amount of output that is overproduced ($Q_m - Q_{opt}$).\n\u003e - It is a loss of social benefits due to overproduction of the good caused by the externality\n\u003e - If the externality were corrected, so that the economy reaches the social optimum, the loss of benefits would disappear.\n\u003e - It may be useful to note that the point of the welfare loss triangle always lies at the $Q_{opt}$ quantity of output.\n\n\n### Negative Consumption Externalities\n- Negative externalities of consumption refer to external costs created by consumers\n- For example, when consumers smoke in public places, there are external costs that spill over onto society in the form of costs to non-smokers due to passive smoking\n- Furthermore, smoking-related diseases result in higher-than-necessary health care costs that are an additional burden upon society\n- When there is a consumption externality, the marginal private benefit (demand) curve does not reflect social benefits\n- When there is a negative consumption externality, the free market overallocates resources to the production of the good, and too much of it is produced relative to what is socially optimum.\n- This is shown by Qm \u003e Qs and MSC \u003e MSB at Qm in the figure.\n\n\u003e[!example]+ Cigarette Smokers\n\u003e- In the Figure, the buyers of cigarettes have a demand curve, MPB, but when smoking, create external costs for non- smokers\n\u003e- These costs can be thought of as ‚Äònegative benefits‚Äô, which therefore cause the MSB curve to lie below the MPB curve.\n\u003e- The vertical difference between MPB and MSB represents the external costs.\n\u003e  ![](images/NCE.png)\n\u003e  -   Note that since the externality involves consumption (i.e. the demand curve), the supply curve represents both marginal private costs and marginal social costs.\n\u003e  -  The market determines an equilibrium quantity, Qm, and price Pm, given by the intersection of the MPB and MPC curves, but the social optimum is Qopt and Popt, determined by the intersection of the MSB and MSC curves.\n\n\u003e [!info]+ Welfare Loss\n\u003e - The welfare (deadweight) loss resulting from negative consumption externalities is the shaded area in the Figure, and represents the reduction in benefits for society due to the overallocation of resources to the production of the good.\n\u003e - For all units of output greater than Qopt, MSC \u003e MSB, indicating that too much of the good is produced.\n\u003e ![](images/Welfareloss2.png)\n\u003e - The welfare loss is equal to the difference between the MSC and MSB curves for the amount of output that is overproduced relative to the social optimum (Qm ‚Äì Qopt).\n\u003e - It represents the loss of social benefits from overproduction due to the externality. If this externality were corrected, society would gain the benefits represented by the shaded area.\n\n\n## Positive Externalities\n- In general, positive externalities (external benefits), whether these arise from production or consumption activities, lead to an underallocation of resources to the good in question, and therefore to its underprovision.\n\n### Positive Production Externalities\n- Positive externalities of production refer to external benefits created by producers\n- If, for example, a firm engages in research and development, and succeeds in developing a new technology that spreads throughout the economy, there are external benefits because not only the firm, but also society, benefits from widespread adoption of the new technology\n- Therefore, the social costs of research and development are lower than the private costs.\n\n\u003e [!example]+ Example\n\u003e - In the Figure, the MSC curve lies below the MPC curve, and the difference between the two curves is the value of the external benefits (these can be thought of as ‚Äònegative costs‚Äô).\n\u003e - The demand curve represents both MPB and MSB since the externality involves only production.\n\u003e - ![](images/PPE.png)\n\u003e - The market gives rise to equilibrium quantity Q m and price Pm, determined by the intersection of the MPB and MPC curves, while the social optimum is given by Qopt and Popt, determined by the intersection of the MSB with MSC curves.\n\u003e - Since Qm \u003c Qopt, the market underallocates resources to research and development activities that lead to new technologies, and not enough of them are undertaken.\n\n\u003e [!info]+ Welfare Loss\n\u003e - The underallocation of resources to the production of a good with a positive production externality leads to a welfare loss, shown in the Figure as the shaded area.\n\u003e - This loss is equal to the difference between the MSB and MSC curves for the amount of output that is underproduced relative to the social optimum (Qopt ‚Äì Qm).\n\u003e ![](images/Welfareloss3.png)\n\u003e - It involves external benefits for society that are lost because not enough of the good is produced. If the externality were corrected, society would gain the benefits represented by the shaded area.\n\u003e -   Note that the point of the welfare loss triangle lies at the Qopt quantity of output.\n\n### Positive Consumption Externalities\n- When there is a positive externality of consumption, the free market under-allocates resources to the production of the good: too few resources are allocated to its production, and too little of it is produced.\n- This is shown by Qm \u003c Qopt and MSB \u003e MSC at Qm\n- When there is a positive externality of consumption, external benefits are created by consumers.\n- For example, the consumption of education benefits the person who receives the education, but in addition gives rise to external benefits, involving social benefits from a more productive workforce, lower unemployment, higher rate of growth, more economic development, lower crime rate, and so on. \n- Similarly, the consumption of health care services benefits not only the person receiving the services but also society and the economy, because a healthier population is more productive, enjoys a higher standard of living and may have a higher rate of economic growth.\n\n\u003e [!example]+ Example\n\u003e - In the Figure, we see that the marginal social benefit (MSB) curve lies above the marginal private benefit (MPB) curve, and the difference between the two consists of the external benefits to society.\n\u003e - The socially optimum quantity, Qopt, is given by the point where MSB = MSC, and the quantity produced by the market is given by the point where MPB = MPC.\n\u003e - Since Qopt \u003e Qm, the market underallocates resources to education, and too little of it is produced.\n\u003e ![](images/Example2.png)\n\n\u003e [!info]+ Welfare Loss\n\u003e - The welfare loss arising from a positive consumption externality is the shaded area in the Figure, and is the difference between the MSB and MSC curves for the amount of output that is underproduced relative to the social optimum (Qopt ‚Äì Qm).\n\u003e ![](images/Welfareloss3%201.png)\n\u003e -   It represents the loss of social benefits due to underproduction of the good.\n\u003e - If this externality were corrected, society would gain the benefits represented by the shaded area.\n\u003e - Once again, we see that the point of the welfare loss triangle lies at the Qopt quantity of output.\n\n- When there is a positive consumption externality, the free market under-allocates resources to the production of the good, and too little of it is produced relative to the social optimum.\n-   This is shown by Qm \u003c Qopt and MSB \u003e MSC at Qm in the Figure.\n\n## Externalities\n**There are some points to bear in mind as you read about externalities**\n- All negative externalities (of production and consumption) create external costs\n\t- When there are external costs, MSC \u003e MSB at the point of production by the market \n- All positive externalities (of production and consumption) create external benefits\n\t- When there are external benefits, MSB \u003e MSC at the point of production by the market\n- All production externalities (positive and negative) create a divergence between private and social costs (MPC and MSC)\n- All consumption externalities (positive and negative) create a divergence between private and social benefits (MPB and MSB)","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/freeandpublicgoods":{"title":"Market Failure - Free and Public Goods","content":"\n#marketfailure\n\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n- We learned that in a free competitive market, when the price of a good adjusts to make quantity demanded equal to quantity supplied, the equilibrium quantity reflects the 'best' or optimal allocation of resources to the production of that good\n- This condition is known as allocative efficiency, achieved when marginal benefit equals marginal cost (MB=MC), or when social surplus is maximum\n\n- Market failure refers to the failure of the market to allocate resources efficiently\n- Market failure results in allocative inefficiency, where too much or too little of goods or services are produced and consumed from the point of view of what is socially most desirable\n- Over-provision (over-provided) of a good means too many/much resources are allocated to its production (over-allocation)\n- Under-provision means that too few resources are allocated to its production (under-allocation)\n\n# Market Failure: 3 Main Sources\n1. Public Goods and Common Resources\n2. Externalities\n3. Market Power\n\n## Public Goods and Common Resources\nWhat is a Public Good?\n- A useful way to classify different goods in the economy is to use 2 criteria (from a viewpoint of allocative efficiency):\n\t1. Rivalry(rival in consumption)\n\t\t- Does consumption by one person reduce supply available to other users?\n\t\t- Increase in consumption by one consumer leads to a fall in total supply of the good\n\t1. Excludability\n\t\t- Whether a good is excludable - is it possible to exclude a non-payer from consuming to good to service?\n\t\t- Exclusion of consumers is made possible, or is not costly\n\n### Private Goods\n- Rivalrous in consumption\n\t- Consumption by one person reduces its availability for someone else\n- Excludable in consumption\n\t- It is possible to exclude people from using the good\n\t- Usually achieved by charging a price\n\t- People who refuse to or cannot pay the price are excluded\n- Since most goods are rivalrous, and excludable, most goods are private goodds\n\n### Public Goods\n- Goods that are non-rival and non-excludable are also known as pure public goods\n- Non-rival in consumption\n- Non-excludable in consumption\n\t- Free rider problem\n- No demand (price signals)\n- No supply\n- Hence no market arises (via price mechanism)\n- Provide significant social benefits\n- E.g., lighthouse\n- Socially desirable\n\n### Public Goods and the Free Rider Problem\n\n**Excludable Goods**\n- It is possible to prevent people from buying and using a good simply by charging a price for it; those who do not pay the price do not buy it and do not get to use it\n- Therefore., private firms have an incentive to provide excludable goods because they can charge a price for them, and therefore can cover their costs\n**Non-Excludable Goods**\n- If a non-excludable good were to be produced by a private firm, people could not be prevented from using it even though they would not pay for it\n- Yet no profit-maximising firm would be willing to produce a good it cannot sell at some price\n- As a result, the market fails to produce goods that are non-excludable, giving rise to resource misallocation, as no resources are allocated to the production of public goods\n**The Free Rider Problem**\n- Arises from non-excludability, people cannot be excluded from using the good\n- Public goods are a type of market failure, because due to the free rider problem, private firms do not produce these goods: the market fails to allocate resources to their production\n\n### Common Access Resources\n- A category of market failure is Common Access Resources (CARs)\n- Not owned by any private individual or firm, so do not have a price, but are available for anyone to use without direct payment\n- Hence, without government intervention, these resources are vulnerable to overuse and abuse\n- E.g., fisheries, irrigations, rivers, forests, atmosphere\n- Even for renewable resources, such as fish stocks, the overuse of these resources can lead to a long-term decline beyond the sustainable level in the stock of natural capital\n- **Non-excludable**\n\t- As they are freely available, there tends to be over-consumption of such resources\n\t- Hence, common access resources are difficult to sustain, which is why governments intervene to prevent the depletion or destruction of such goods\n- **Rivalrous**\n\t- Consumption of these resources diminishes the quantity and possibly quality of remaining resources for the current and future generations to use\n\t- In the case of over-consumption of CARs, sustainability becomes a real issue so generations to come may be deprived of any access to these resources\n- **Tragedy of the commons**\n\t- CARs create a situation known as the \"Tragedy of the Commons\"\n\t- This means: Degradation, depletion or destruction of a CAR caused by the problems of overuse (or abuse) and over-consumption\n\t![](images/tragedyofthecommons.png)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Economics/policies":{"title":"Market Failure - Policies","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)\n\n#ongoing\n\n## Negative Externalities of Production\n### Government regulations\n- Rely on \"command\" approach, using authority to enact legislation and regulations in the public's interest\n- Regulations can be used to prevent or reduce the effects of production externalities\n- In the case of the polluting firm, regulations can forbid the dumping of certain toxic substances into the environment\n- More commonly, regulations do not totally ban the production of pollutants, but rather attempt to achieve one of the following\n\t1.

Example is General Sales Tax (GST)\n\n## Indirect Tax\n- Shifts the supply curve up by the amount of tax imposed\n### **Specific Tax**\n\n-   Good or service is taxed a fixed amount per unit\n    -   e.g. $5 per kg\n-   Hence, tax per unit of the good is the same regardless the price of the good\n-   Specific tax imposes a parallel shift **(of the supply curve)** upwards by the full amount of the tax\n\n### **************************Ad Valorem Tax***************************\n\n-   Good or service is taxed a ********************percentage******************** based on the **********value********** of the product\n    -   e.g. 7% GST\n-   Hence, the higher the price of the good, the higher the tax per unit of the good will be\n-   Pivots the supply curve upwards, i.e. skewed upwards\n\nTaxes on a demand and supply curve **only affects the supply curve**\n\n## Effects of Taxation\n\n1.  **Impact** of a tax\n    1.

It should take place during an authentic period in history and be set in a real historical place. For example, New York City during the Great Depression or Paris, France during WWII\n            - Plot - The plot in a historical fiction novel is a combination of a real events and fictional events. You can invent characters, cities and events, but they still must make sense to the time period. For example, a novel set in London, Engalnd in 1666 would benefit from incorporating the Great Fire of London, a major turning point in the city's history\n            - Characters - The characters can be real, fictional or both, but they should all look, speak and act in ways that accurately reflect the era\n            - Dialogue - register, vernacular, diction\n            - Conflict\n    - Are literature and history antagonists?\n        - History is about facts and time, while literature is about fiction and language\n        - In¬†_The Order of Things_¬†Foucault argues is that the relationship between literature and history might be more complicated than this binary suggests. He explains systems of understanding, including subjects or disciplines\n        - The work of historian Hayden White follows this line of thinking. White points out that history is intimately involved in the re-presentation of prior events\n        - History is always being made rather than something safely secured in what we might call and recall as the past. So, the practice of writing history relies on interpretation and representation, the very devices of fiction and fiction reading\n        - White concluded, not uncontroversially, that \"history is no less than a form of fiction than the novel is a form of historical representation\".

The characters are usually the vessel by which the author tells the story. Are the characters typical of a genre? Do they fit a certain archetype? Are some characters good and some evil?  \nRemember, it‚Äôs how _you_ perceive the character.\n\n**Setting**\nAn understanding of setting will assist you with all different types of narrative texts. In certain genres such as wester and horror, the setting is very fundamental. However, no matter the text, the setting is going to play a key role.\n\n**Plot (Structure)**\nHow has the text been structured? Is there a flashback? Does it loop? The structure of the text is important in identifying how the author wants you as a reader to uncover his message. This is highly important in short stories, also.\n\n**Syntax**\nSyntax is the way that words and phrases are put together in a sentence. Sometimes authors will adhere to syntax and sometimes they will play around with the syntax, which is just as significant. Take a look at the syntax and try to understand what is going on with the author‚Äôs writing.\n\n**Tone**\nThe tone of a novel or story is a big determinant in the message of the narrative. It is important to identify tone, whether it be serious or sarcastic.  \nIdentify adjectives and try to find the mood/tone it creates.\n\n**Style**\nWhat style has been employed to write this narrative? This will require you understanding the key terminology surrounding style.  \nHow the story is written.\n\n**Dialogue**\nDialogue is anytime that someone speaks within your narrative. It can be very telling about a number of things and can reveal things about your characters, in a different way to your narrator.\n\n**Emotive language**\nThe use of emotive language is very significant is it positions the reader to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù what the author wants them to. This is important when talking about serious issues.\n\n**Point of view**\nFirst-person, second person, third person limited and third-person omniscient are all different methods of an author telling a story. Each of these is significant in their own right.\n\n**Statistics**\nData on a subject, e.g., number of unemployed people\n\n**Expert opinion**\nA professional giving an opinion on a subject they have studied\n\n**Metaphors**\nA metaphor is a useful language tool that compares two things that have nothing in common. E.g. Lost in a sea of nameless faces.\n\n**Similes**\nA simile is when something is said to be like something else. E.g. Her smile was as bright as a sun.\n\n**Personification**\nPersonification is when an inanimate object is assigned with a human-like quality. E.g., The daffodils danced in the breeze.\n\n**Hyperbole**\nThis is an exaggeration of the fact. E.g., She was so hungry she could have eaten a horse\n\n**Imagery**\nA great author can conjure up pictures in your mind through the use of imagery. This is a very descriptive language that paints a visual picture.\n\n**Allusion**\nAn allusion is a reference to something else. E.g., Bec was the Trojan horse to Marta‚Äôs social group. Think ‚ÄúEaster Eggs‚Äù  \n\n**Symbolism**\nSymbolism can be anything from a dagger to colour and usually has a hidden meaning.  \nSomething that represents something else. E.g., dark background symbolises unknown, mystery\n\n**Satire**  \nA mocking representation of something, e.g., making fun of something\n\n**Diction**\nDiction is the choice and use of words in the writing and can be highly significant. Look for unusual word choices and anything that seems significant and what those particular words connote.\n\n**Repetition**\nWhen words or ideas are repeated in a text, it usually means that the author is trying to point your attention to that thing.\n\n**Oxymoron**\nFigure of speech that has 2 contradicting terms, e.g., terribly good\n\n**Irony**\nA technique of indicating, as through character or plot development, an intention or attitude opposite to that which is actually or ostensibly stated.\n\n**Dramatic Irony**\nIrony that is inherent in speeches or a situation of a drama and is understood by the audience but not grasped by the characters in the play.\n\n**Foreshadowing**\nAn indication of something that will happen in the future, often used as a literary device to hint at or allude to future plot developments:","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Literature/ExamInformation":{"title":"Exam Information","content":"\n\n## Practice Questions\n1.

I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed.\" - Ensfield\n\t- His character has been \"exposed\", as fearful and meek, not the sophisticated man he would like to be\n- The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. \"I do not care to hear more,\" said he. \"This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\" - Jekyll\n\t- Jekyll's emotional side was shown, and he does not want to talk about it, for fear of exposing himself\n\n### Symbolism: Separation between public and private life\n- Use of doors is prevalent\n- Symbolises the Victorian Era‚Äôs preoccupation with the separation of public life and private life\n- The front door of Jekyll‚Äôs house and the back door of the laboratory, for example, represent physical barriers between the curious eyes of the public and the hidden activities inside\n\t- His servants are not allowed to enter\n- Hyde's house door is \"blistered and destained\"\n\t- Possibly a symbol for how his attempts to hide himself have failed, e.g. the story of the door, and when he tramples an old man\n\n## Hedda Gabler\n- Core Concept: **Context influencing Main Ideas**\n- Context: 19th Century Europe, the patriarchy was prevalent in most societies\n- Ibsen wanted to reflect this in a negative way, and rebel against it, so to speak\n- Evident in Hedda's character, in that she wants to be free\n- **Thesis:** Due to the patriarchal views in the 1800s, Ibsen rejects these views and instead portrays females as strong, while also ridiculing the current patriarchal expectations of women. Ibsen uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and dialogue to provide a scathing social criticism on the patriarchal's views.\n  \n- Points\n\t- **Foreshadowing: Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms**\n\t- **Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek**\n\t\t- Guns\n\t\t- Chekov's gun????\n\t-  **Dialogue: Uses stereotypical representation of females in order to show how ridiculous said stereotypes are**\n\n### Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms, using foreshadowing\n- Hedda is represented as someone who wants freedom\n- **Hedda:** I‚Äôm content‚Ä¶so long as you don‚Äôt have any sort of hold over me.\n\t- Threatens Judge Brack as he blackmails her\n\t- Claims she is \"no longer free\"\n\t- Foreshadows that once she realises she is no longer free, she kills herself\n- **Hedda:** I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny \n  **Mrs Elvsted:** Have you not the power?\n  **Hedda:** I have not‚Äîand have never had it.\n\t- Foreshadows her death, as she has the power to end her destiny, so to speak\n\n### Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek\n- Symbolism of guns\n- Chekov's gun, she kills herself with the guns after being controlled\n- Her connection to the guns suggests that Hedda is her father's daughter, not her husband's wife, representing independence\n- **Hedda:** I‚Äôm going to shoot you sir!\n\t- Shows her familiarity with the guns\n- **Hedda:** I‚Äôve got one thing at least that I can pass the time with.  \n  **Tesman:** Oh, thank the good Lord for that!

Over the play, Hedda is forced to evaluate her life and the roles she plays - as a wife, woman and person\n- Ibsen of the title of the play - \"My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter than her husband's wife\"\n- The play critiques the marriage, society and gender norms of the time and as such provoked great controversy when premiered\n- The play helped usher in the **realism** movement - focused on everyday people experiencing everyday problems.

have at least 1 non-radioactive isotope, except for Te and Pm\n- All elements after uranium are not known in nature\n\n## Nuclear Decay\n- Unstable nucleus emits radiation and is transformed into the nucleus of one or more other element\n\n## Transmutations\n- Change in chemical of an atom\n- Completely random, spontaneous process\n\n## **Atoms**\n-   Central part of an atom is the nucleus\n-   Consists of:\n\t-   Neutrons\n\t\t-   No charge: 0\n\t\t-   Relative Atomic Mass: 1\n\t-   Protons\n\t\t-   Positive Charge +\n\t\t-   Relative Atomic Mass: 1\n-   Collectively called nucleons\n-   Almost identical in mass and size\n-   Most of an atom is empty space that is only occupied by electrons\n-   Any change in the amount of protons changes the element¬†\n-   Electrons\n\t-   Negative Charge: -\n\t-   Relative Atomic Mass: 1/1836\n\t-   Orbit nucleus at high speeds\n$$^A_ZX$$\nA: Mass number\n-   No. of Neutrons + No. of Protons\nZ: Atomic number¬†\n-   Number of protons in the atom\n\n## **Isotopes**\n-   All atoms of a particular element have the same amount of protons\n-   However, they may have a different amount of neutrons\n-   Isotopes are chemically identical to each other\n-   They react and bond with other atoms in the exact same\n-   Number of neutrons does not affect in which an atom interacts with other atoms\n-   It is the electrons that determine this\n-   It affects the physical properties\n-   More neutrons in the atom means that the atom will be more dense\n-   When referring to a particular nucleus, we refer to it as a ‚Äúnuclide‚Äù\n-   In this case, we ignore the presence of the electrons\n\n## **Radioisotopes**\n-   Most of the atoms that make up the world are stable\n-   Their nuclei have not changed, and will not change independently\n-   However there are also naturally occurring isotopes that are unstable\n-   An unstable nucleus may spontaneously lose energy by emitting a particle\n-   They change into a different element or isotope\n-   Unstable atoms are radioactive\n-   An individual **radioactive isotope** is called a **radioisotope**\n-   Nearly all elements found in the Earth‚Äôs crust have naturally occurring isotopes\n-   Over 2000 known radioisotopes, most of which are artificially produced\n\n## **Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Radiation**\n-   Around 100 years ago as of 2022, Ernest Rutherford and Paul Villard discovered that there were 3 different types of emission from radioactive substances\n-   They called these **Alpha, Beta and Gamma Radiation**\n-   Further experiments showed that the alpha and beta emissions were actually particles expelled from the nucleus\n-   Gamma radiation was found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation, also emanating from the nucleus\n### **Alpha Decay: $\\alpha$**\n-   When a heavy nucleus undergoes radioactive decay, it may eject an alpha particle\n-   Alpha particle: positively charged chunk of matter\n-   Consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons\n-   Ejected from nucleus of a radioactive atom\n-   Ionising ability: ability to create ions\n\t- High ionising ability, as it has a high positive charge, and can displace electrons from other atoms\n\t- Since it is positively charged, it collides with a lot of other atoms and loses energy, dislodging electrons from those atoms\n-   An alpha particle is identical to a helium nucleus¬†\n-   Very massive\n-   Heavily charged\n-   Usually from heavy elements\n$$^4_2 He^{2+}$$\n$$^4_2 \\alpha ^{2+}$$\n**Example**\nUranium-238 is radioactive and may decay by emitting an alpha particle from its nucleus. This can be represented in a nuclear equation where the changes occurring in the nuclei can be seen. Electrons are **not considered** in these equations, only nucleons. The equation for the alpha decay of uranium-238 is: $$^{238}_{92}U -\u003e^{234}_{90}Th+^4_2 He^{2+}+energy$$\nIn the decay process, the parent nucleus **238-92-U** has spontaneously emitted an alpha particle (‚ç∫) and has changed into a completely different element, **234-90-Th.** Thorium-234 is called the daughter nucleus. The energy released is mostly kinetic energy carried by the fast-moving alpha particle. When an atom changes into a different element, it is said to have undergone a **nuclear transmutation**. In nuclear transmutations, electric charge is conserved‚Äîseen as a conservation of atomic number In the example, 90+2 = 92. The number of nucleons¬† is also conserved; 234+4 = 238.\n\n## **Beta Decay**\n-   Beta particles are electrons\n-   Originated from **nucleus** of a radioactive atom¬†\n-   Not from electron cloud\n-   Can be written as:\n$$^0_{-1}e^{-}$$\n$$^0 _{-1}\\beta ^-$$\n  \n\n-   The atomic number of -1 indicates that it has a single negative charge\n-   Mass number of 0 indicates its mass is far less than a proton or neutron\n-   Beta decay occurs in nuclei where there is an imbalance of neutrons to protons\n-   Typically, if a light nucleus has too many neutrons to be stable, a neutron will spontaneously change into a proton\n- Ionising ability is medium\n\t- Since it is negatively charged, it is repelled by the electron cloud of other atoms\n\t- Experiences a large number of collisions, but expends less energy from them\n\t- Therefore less ionising\n-   Electron and a uncharged massless particle called an **antineutrino** are ejected to restore the nucleus to a more stable state\n- Antineutrino is symbolised as $\\overline{V}$ \n\n**Example**\nIsotopes of carbon: **C-12-6, C-13-6 and C-14-6**. Carbon-12 and 13 are both stable, but carbon 14 is unstable. It has more neutrons, and therefore undergoes a beta decay to be stable. In the process, one of the neutrons changes into a proton. As a result, the proton number increases to 7, and so the product is not carbon. Nitrogen-14 is formed. The nuclear equation for this decay is: $$^{14}_{6}C-\u003e {^{14}_{6}N}+{^0_{-1}e+ \\overline{V}+energy}$$The transformation taking place in the nucleus is: $$^1_0n-\u003e^1_0p+^0_{-1}e+ \\overline{V}$$\n-   n: neutrons\n-   p: protons\n-   e: beta particle\nOnce again, notice how in all these equations, the atomic and mass numbers are conserved. The antineutrino has no charge and has so little mass that both its atomic and mass numbers are 0\n\n### Beta Decay (Positrons)\n- A different form of beta decay occurs in atoms that have too many protons\n- A proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (Œ≤+). This is known as a Œ≤+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron\n- Positrons have the same properties as electrons, but their electrical charge is positive rather than negative. Positrons are an example of antimatter.\n\n**Example**\nThe radioactive decay of unstable nitrogen-12. There are 7 protons and 5 neutrons in the nucleus, and a proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (Œ≤+). This is known as a Œ≤+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron. The equation is: $${^{14}_{6}N}-\u003e^{14}_{6}C+{^0_{+1}e+ \\overline{V}+energy}$$\n\n### Gamma Decay\n- Generally, after a radioisotope has emitted an alpha/beta particle, the daughter nucleus holds an excess of energy\n- The protons and neutrons in the daughter nucleus then rearrange slightly and offload this excess energy by releasing gamma radiation (high-frequency electromagnetic radiation)\n- Ionising ability is low\n\t- Interact with matter infrequently when they collide directly with the nucleus or an electron\n\t- Low density of the atom makes this infrequent, therefore it cannot dislodge electrons as much as beta particles\n\t- Low ionisation ability\n- Gamma rays‚Äîlike all light‚Äîhave no mass and are uncharged\n- However, it contains a lot of energy\n- Symbol is: $$^0_0 \\gamma$$\n- Being a form of light, gamma rays travel at the speed of light\n- Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation/waves, and have the shortest wavelength\n- They are photons\n\n**Example:**\nA common example of a gamma ray emitter is iodine-131. Iodine-131 decays by beta and gamma radiation to form xenon-131. The equation for this is: $$^{131}_{53}I-\u003e{^{131}_{54}Xe+^0_{-1}e+^0_0 \\gamma}$$\n**These equations can also be written with $\\alpha,\\beta$ or $\\gamma$ written over the reaction arrow**\n\n| Type of Radiation   | Alpha                                                    | Beta                                                   | Gamma                                                |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| Symbol              | $^4_2 He$ or $^4_2 \\alpha$                               | $^0_{-1} \\beta ^-$ or $^0_{-1}e^-$                     | $^0_0 \\gamma$                                        |\n| Mass (amu)          | 4                                                        | $\\frac{1}{1836}$                                       | 0                                                    |\n| Charge              | 2+                                                       | -                                                      | 0                                                    |\n| Speed               | slow                                                     | fast                                                   | very fast (speed of light = $3 \\times 10^8 \\ ms^-1$) |\n| Ionising ability    | high                                                     | medium                                                 | low                                                  |\n| Penetrating ability | low                                                      | medium                                                 | high                                                 |\n| Stopped by:         | paper                                                    | aluminium                                              | lead                                                 |\n| Remember:           | Atomic number decreases by 2, atomic mass decreases by 4 | Atomic number increases by 1, atomic mass is unchanged | Atomic number and atomic mass are unchanged          |\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Physics/SIS":{"title":"Science Inquiry Skills","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)\n\n**************Accuracy:****************** How close your experimentally derived number is to the ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúreal‚Äù quantity being measured\n\n***Precision:****** How the repeat values or a given trial are to each other, ***OR*** the fineness of the scale on the instrument being used to take measurements\n\n***Reliability:*** If we conduct more trials and find that the results we get each time are not significantly different from the others\n\n***************Validity:************** No other variables, known or unknown, are impacting the independent or dependent variables (fair tests)\n\n# Uncertainty/Error\n\n********Measurement uncertainty:******** uncertainty which is a property of the measuring instrument\n\n-   Unavoidable, quantifiable, hopefully very small\n\n********Systematic Error:******** Impacts each trial in the same direction away from the true value\n\n-   Bias in direction\n\n**************************Random Error:************************** Impacts each trial but with no bias in direction, and if truly random, should cancel out with respect to accuracy\n\n************************Absolute uncertainty(AU):************************\n\n-   A.k.a.

Surface waves decay more slowly with distance than body waves which travel in three dimensions.\n- Amplitude of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so surface waves tend to cause more damage.\n- Different travel times of seismic waves are used to locate their epicentre\n- Refraction or reflection of seismic waves is used for research into Earth's internal structure\n- Scientists sometimes generate and measure vibrations to investigate shallow, subsurface structures.\n- Compressional waves: Seismic, longitudinal body waves\n- Shear waves: Seismic, transverse body waves\n\n### P-Waves \n- Primary waves (P-waves) are compressional waves that are longitudinal in nature. \n- P-waves are pressure waves that travel faster than other waves through the earth to arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name \"Primary\". \n- These waves can travel through any type of material, including fluids, and can travel nearly 1.7 times faster than the S-waves. \n- In air, they take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound\n\n### S-Waves\n- Secondary waves (S-waves) are shear waves that are transverse in nature. \n- Following an earthquake event, S-waves arrive at seismograph stations after the faster-moving P-waves and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation.\n- Depending on the propagational direction, the wave can take on different surface characteristics; for example, in the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S-waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses. \n- S-waves are slower than P-waves, and speeds are typically around 60% of that of P-waves in any given material. \n- Shear waves can't travel through any liquid medium, so the absence of S-waves in earth's outer core suggests a liquid state.","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Physics/Superposition":{"title":"Superposition","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)\n\n- Superposition occurs when 2 waves travelling in the same medium meet\n- Their amplitudes combine algebraically to produce a resultant wave **at that particular instant**\n- When the 2 waves superimpose, the resultant displacement of the particles is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual displacements of the original waves\n\n## Constructive Interference\n- 2 waves of equal frequency that are **in phase** interfere/superimpose\n- Resultant wave has an amplitude greater than each of the individual waves\n- Equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves\n\n### Application: Amplified Speakers\n- When 2 speakers are made to produce the same sound, the sound waves produced interfere with each other\n- Thus, at certain places (anti-nodes), constructive interference occurs, and the sound is louder (amplitude increases)\n- At nodes, destructive interference occurs, and the sound is quieter (amplitude decreases)\n\n## Destructive Interference\n- 2 waves of equal frequency that are **not in phase** meet and superimpose, crating a resultant wave that has amplitude lower than each of the individual waves\n- Here the individual waves have positive and negative amplitudes, and so they combine to produce a wave of smaller amplitude\n- **Complete Destructive Interference**\n\t- 2 waves of equal frequency that are completely **not in phase**, i.e. 180Àö out of phase, combine\n\t- Negative amplitude of one wave, and the positive amplitude of other combine to completely cancel out at the instant when they meet\n\n### Application: Noise Cancelling Headphones\n- Incoming sound waves have specific waveforms\n- External microphones detect this ambient sound and invert the waveform\n- As the ambient sound and inverted sound are 180Àö **out of phase**, complete destructive interference occurs, and thus the listener hears nothing\n- The inverted sound is such that it does not combine with the music sound wave, thus listeners can still hear their music\n\n## Standing Waves\n- Resultant wave that forms when 2 waves of **equal frequency** and **amplitude** that are **moving in the opposite direction** meet\n- No net transfer of energy\n- Wave does not travel in any direction\n- **Nodes**: In a standing wave, there are moments when the 2 identical waves travelling in opposite directions are 180Àö out of phase; here a complete destructive interference occurs, and there is no particle displacement\n- **Anti-nodes**: There are also moments when 2 identical waves are in phase and so complete constructive interference occurs and there is maximum particle displacement; here the particles vibrate about the equilibrium position but do not propagate in any direction\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Physics/UltrasoundImaging":{"title":"Ultrasound Imaging","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)\n\n- Ultrasound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves, with a frequency of between 1000 to 20000 Hz. \n\t- This is above the human hearing range.\n- Ultrasound imaging is a form of medical imaging that uses ultrasound waves to create an image of internal body structures, e.g. organs. \n\t- The most common use of this is for pregnancy, to have an ultrasound image of the baby.\n- Ultrasound waves are used in medical imaging for a few reasons. \n\t- One reason is that since they are outside the audible range, they don‚Äôt cause discomfort to the patient. \n\t- Another reason is that ultrasound waves have very high frequencies, which produce a better resolution as they diffract less. Therefore, their intensity is maintained for longer distances, and more superficial structures can be imaged. \n\t- Finally, it‚Äôs a good alternative to x-ray, as it doesn‚Äôt have a possibility of causing cancer, and some structures in x-ray scans aren‚Äôt shown, such as soft tissue.\n- However, since ultrasound waves don‚Äôt travel well through air or bone, it is not effective at rendering bones or parts filled with gas. \n- Furthermore, ultrasound imaging may not be able to identify objects deep within the body.\n\n## Process\n1.  A transducer generates pulses as it moves along the surface of the tissue. The pulses travel through a conductive gel(which enables direct transmission of the wave from the transducer to the tissue) and into the tissue, and 3 things happen.\n2.  Wave‚Äôs Journey\n    1.  Due to absorption, the waves lose intensity and energy as they travel further into the tissue. Therefore their amplitude decreases as they travel into the tissue.\n    2.  The ultrasound waves reflect at the intermedia between 2 tissue\n        1.  When the wave hits a smooth surface, and the wavelength is smaller than the imaged surface, **specular reflection** occurs . Thus, a single, reflected wave is formed, moving in one direction\n        2.  When the wave hits a rough surface, **diffuse reflection** occurs. The wave is reflected in multiple directions with lower amplitudes, and thus intensities. \n        3. The ultrasound waves have a possibility to refract, causing a change in the ultrasound wave speed and wavelength\n        4. Acoustic impedance (ai) is a property that measures the resistance ultrasound waves encounter in tissue. A higher density of tissue means a greater acoustic impedance, which means that the ultrasound waves are deflected with a smaller decrease in intensity. Thus, at the surface of dense tissue, e.g. bones, the reflection, and thus the intensity, is greater. The larger the difference in acoustic impedance between the 2 mediums, the greater the fraction of the wave that is reflected, and vice versa. \n3. The reflected waves arrive at the transducer\n4.  The distance between interfaces is calculated using the angle of return and time take to return\n    1.  This is because of $s=vt$, and the law of reflection\n5.  A grey scale image is produced, using their intensity\n    1.  Greater intensity of reflected light means a whiter image, thus denser objects (e.g. bone) appear brighter than rarer objects\n6.  An image that shows the boundaries of various structures and their densities is created, and is known as a sonogram\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Physics/Variable":{"title":"Important Variables to Know","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)\n\n## Vectors (require direction and magnitude)\ns: Displacement\n- in meters\nv: Velocity\n- $ms^{-1}$, meters per second\nF: force\n- Newtons\nJ: work\n- Joules\ni: Impulse\n- $kg\\ ms^{-1}$, kg per meters per second\nW: watts\np: Momentum\n- $kg\\ ms^{-1}$, kg per meters per second\nN: Newtons\na: Acceleration\n- $ms^{-2}$, meters per, seconds squared\ng: Gravity, 9.8 $ms^{-2}$ , meters per, seconds squared\n\n## Scalars (require magnitude)\nm: Mass\n- grams\n|v|: Speed\n-  $ms^{-1}$, meters per second\n|s|, sometimes s: Displacement\n- meters\nt: Time\n- seconds\nh: Height\n- meters\n\n\n# To convert $kmh^{-1}$ to $ms^{-1}$, divide by $3.6$\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.535397995Z","tags":[]},"/11Physics/Waves":{"title":"Waves","content":"\n[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)\n\n- Waves: The transfer of energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter\n\t- I.e. after energy is transferred, there is no displacement of matter\n- Mechanical waves: transfer energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter, but requires a medium to propagate\n\t- The particles in the medium vibrate back and forth about fixed positions (equilibrium position)\n- Transverse waves: particles vibrate perpendicular to the direction of energy flow, e.g. water, electromagnetic waves\n- Longitudinal waves: particles vibrate along straight lines parallel to the direction of the energy flow\n\n- However:\n\t1. Assumes no other disturbances in the motion\n\t2. Ignores situations where there is no medium\n- Requirements for medium:\n\t1. Mechanical waves must have a medium, e.g. sound\n\t2. Non-mechanical waves do not require a medium, e.g. EMR\n\n## Anatomy of a Wave\n![](images/236375072-3709402252.png)\n- Crest: Highest displacement of a particle in the positive direction\n\t- Highest point in the graph\n- Trough: Lowest displacement of a particle in the negative direction\n\t- Lowest point in the graph\n- Wavelength ($\\lambda$): Distance between any 2 consecutive points in a wave that are in phase\n\t- From one crest to another crest\n\t- From one trough to another trough\n\t- Distance it takes for the wave to repeat\n- Frequency (f): The number of complete oscillations per second. Unit of frequency is the Hz(Hertz)\n\t- Remains constant, even if reflected/refracted\n\t- Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to one another\n- Period (T): Time take for one wavelength to complete (seconds), equal to $$\\frac{1}{f}$$\n- Phase: State of vibration that a particle has reached in its cycle of motion. Waves are in phase when particles of the wave move in the exact same way at the same time\n- Speed = distance/time\n- Distance = speed $\\times$ time\n- Time = distance/speed\n$$v=f{\\lambda}=\\frac{\\lambda}{T}$$\n- Speed of sound at $25Àö C$ is $346$ $ms^{-1}$\n- $f$ remains constant, thus if $v$ increases, $\\lambda$ increases\n## Wave Behaviours\n- Energy incident upon a surface is\n\t- Reflected\n\t- Absorbed\n\t- Transmitted (goes through the object)\n\t- Usually a combination of these 3\n\n## Reflection\n### Reflection\n- When energy is incident upon a surface (e.g. boundary between 2 different mediums), then some/all of the energy \"bounces\" back into the original medium\n### Law of Reflection\n- The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence\n- Angle of incidence: angle between the incident ray and the normal\n\n## Refraction\n- Occurs when a wave passes from the medium to another, at an angle other than 90Àö and changes direction\n- Changes speed, and therefore wavelength, but not frequency\n- NB: The media may simply be referred to as slow(er) or fast(er)\n- We all know that in order of density, solid \u003e liquid \u003e air \u003e vacuum\n\t- Sound: speed of sound increases with density of medium\n\t- Light: speed of light decreases with density of medium\n\t\t- If a ray goes into a slower medium it bends towards the normal\n\n## Diffraction\n- Bending/spreading of waves beyond a gap/slit/aperture with no change in wavelength, frequency or velocity\n- **Diffraction around corners**\n\t- When a wave moves past a corner, due to the wavefront being a source of secondary wavelets; the wave diffracts and spreads out. \n\t- The area where there is no diffraction is called the shadow region\n![](images/Diffraction1.png)\n- **Wavelength Effect**\n\t- Diffraction increases with increase in wavelength. \n\t- Thus long wavelength (low frequency) waves are diffracted more than short wavelength (high frequency) waves\n\t- This is why ultrasound waves don‚Äôt diffract much and are used for locating purposes such as in sonar or ultrasound; they do not disperse/diffract much at all.\n![](images/Diffraction2.png)\n- **Aperture Size Effect** \n\t- As the aperture size increases, the extent of diffraction decreases. \n\t- As the aperture Size decreases, the extent of diffraction increases \n\t- The diffraction is greater when wavelength size is roughly equal to the aperture size\n\t- For apertures smaller than the wavelength size, there is no diffraction\n![](images/Diffraction3.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.539397961Z","tags":[]},"/11Physics/WorkForcePower":{"title":"Work, Force and Powewr","content":"\n[go

Holding the mass of the car and the total change in velocity constant (as when braking you will always be breaking from a set speed), the impulse for the car will be constant as well, because $I=m\\Delta v$\n-   When a car breaks suddenly, as the non-seat-belt-wearing passengers have a tendency to maintain their path (inertia), they are flung forward until they collide with the front; at this point, a force acts on them to slow them down along with the car\n\n### Crumple Zones\n\n-   When 2 cars collide, the crumple zone contracts (absorbing the impact force) and thus a retarding force is applied on the car through a larger amount of time.\n-   Thus, as impulse is constant; as (t) increases, the retarding force applied to the car decreases, thus the damage done to humans inside the car is decreased\n\n### Airbags\n\n-   When a passenger experiences a car crash; the air bag increases the amount of time it takes for the passenger‚Äôs head to experience the retarding force.\n-   Thus for a constant impulse, the time over which the force is experienced increases, the force applied decreases\n\n### Seatbelts\n\n-   All objects have inertia; a tendency to maintain their state of motion\n-   When a collision occurs our body will also maintain their state of motion and continue to travel forwards if no unbalanced force is applied to oppose this motion\n-   A seat belt is used to apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction of the motion, causing our bodies to decelerate rapidly; preventing us from crashing out the wind

Nuclear Power Stations\n\n### **Pros**\n-   Energy efficient\n-   Small land footprint\n-   Average nuclear power plant producing 2000 MW takes up a square mile of space\n-   Very powerful, energy wise\n-   Reliable\n-   Produce their maximum power output 93% of the time\n-   Very stable\n-   Produces no greenhouse gases\n### **Cons**\n-   Closely connected to nuclear weapon technology production/proliferation\n-   Dangerous to society\n-   Nuclear waste\n-   Extremely poisonous products\n-   Takes 10s of 1000s of years to stop being radioactive/poisonous\n-   Possibility of nuclear accidents\n-   Uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions\n-   Neutrons from fission reaction create another fission reaction\n-   Causes excess of energy in the form of heat\n-   Sometimes the heat is too much for the reactor to handle\n-   It melts, and radioactive waste is expelled\n-   Expensive to set up\n-   Uranium is expensive\n\n### **Nuclear Power Station Components**\n-   Fuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium\n-   Moderator: material that slows down neutrons\n\t-   Graphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide\n\t-   Heavy water is the best but is too expensive\n\t-   Water with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen\n\t-   Graphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen\n\t-   Ensures that neutron capture occurs\n\t-   When the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy\n-   Control rods: material that absorbs neutrons\n\t-   Boron steel or cadmium\n\t-   Ensures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission\n-   Coolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down\n\t-   e.g. water\n-   Radiation shield: thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%208.00.46%20pm.png)\n\n## **Uses of Radiation**\n### **Medical Tracers**\n-   Radioactive substance injected into the body\n-   Usually iodine, as it is absorbed by the thyroid gland\n-   They measure the gamma radiation emitted to track pathways or image the body\n-   Gamma is used as it is very penetrative (easier to measure from surface), and is less deadly in equal amounts (from the inside) than alpha and beta\n### **Industrial Tracers**\n-   Radioactive substance used in factories/industrial use\n-   Much the same concept as a medical tracer\n-   Injected into the system\n-   Finds leaks in systems, or tracks certain chemicals\n-   You can use a radioactive tracer if any escapes\n### **X-Rays**\n-   Electromagnetic waves are directed at the area of concern\n-   A material is placed behind the area\n-   The x-ray penetrates your body and into the area\n-   They image the shadows in the area to find out what‚Äôs wrong\n-   The bones absorb the x-ray, making this very useful, as we can see shadows, of the bone, or we can observe the brighter sections to view the muscles\n### **Radiometric/Carbon Dating**\n-   Radioactive dating uses the known half-life of an isotope and its composition to determine the age of a specimen\n-   The most common is carbon dating, but that‚Äôs only good for 40-50000 years\n-   When an archeological specimen is created in its time, it will mostly be carbon 14, but will slowly, over thousands of years, decay into nitrogen 14\n-   By measuring how much nitrogen/carbon 14 is present, we can very accurately determine the age of the specimen by comparing it to the carbon-12 levels of living things\n-   Carbon has a half life of 5730 years\n-   Since it‚Äôs only good for 40-50000 years, it‚Äôs good for measuring the age of human artefacts and similar things, but useless for determining things in the millions, e.g. dinosaur fossils, ancient rock formations\n-   For this, we use the decay of uranium into lead, which takes around 4.5 billion years\n-   By measuring how much lead is present, we can also determine the age of this

Championships 2023","content":"[go back](Articles.md)\n\nWritten on 3rd-4th April 2023.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSo...as a hobby, I play a funny little game called Pok√©mon. You might've heard of it. It's only the best selling video game franchise of all time. Not just the story mode, but also the competitive mode, also known as VGC, or Video Game Competition formats. I played on [Pok√©mon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), but this year, I had the chance to attend a physical, official event known as the Perth Regionals.\n\nThis event was spread out over 2 days, the 3rd and 4th of March. Players would compete in 7 rounds of Best of 3, and the top 8 would move onto the 2nd day. 3 points were allocated for a win, and 0 points were added for a loss, with 1 point being added for draws. The 8 players with the highest amount of points would move on to the next day. Your ranking was also determined by the opponents you faced. For example, someone who beat the top player but only had 1 win would be ranked higher than someone who beat the bottom player with 1 win.\n\nThis was in the Series 2 format, which allowed Paradox Pok√©mon, and the regional Paldea Dex, apart from the Ruins. If you have no idea what it is, just search it up. It was an Open Team Sheet format, which meant we could see our opponent's Pok√©mon and their moves, abilities, items, and Tera-type, but not their stats.\n\nI competed in the VGC Masters Division, which consists of people 16 years and over.\n\n## Teambuilding\n\n\u003e [!quote] Alpharad\n\u003e \n\u003e \"I don't know if any of you dabble in competitive Pok√©mon, but if you do, you should know what Flutter Mane is!\"\n\nI had a lot of trouble making/finding a team to use, as I hadn't finished the game yet, and I didn't get much time to play. My friends Kat and Preston were kind enough to build the team for me, so all I had to do was find a team. I ended up settling on this team here, which was covered by CybertronVGC in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvyGNSWsdPU).\n![](Articles%20images/vgc_thing.png)\n\nThe strategy revolved around Iron Moth's Acid Spray, which does damage and lowers Special Defence by 2 stages. Flutter Mane and Glimmora, being special attackers, would take advantage of this. Kingambit and Dondozo were for physical moves and bulk, as my team was a hyper-offense team. Tatsugiri was there, because....it just works well with Dondozo. All had defensive Tera-Types except for Flutter Mane and Tatsugiri. \n\n\nI managed to squeeze in a bit of practice on Showdown, but only managed to get a few games off in the in-game ladder. \n\n## The Start of the Event\n\nThe day arrived on 3rd of March, 2023. As always, I didn't sleep well, and saw immediately that most of the competition was adults. Most of them had flown in from other states. I saw a few people with merch from Worlds (the Pok√©mon World Championships, which was held in London last year). Daunted, but still determined to win, I entered the venue.\n\nThere were 131 people registered for the tournament, but only 113 participants for some reason....I have no idea why.\n\nThere were some people wearing awesome merch. There was a Greninja cosplayer, a person with a Tera-Ghost Garganacl shirt with the phrase, \"It gets worse\", a guy with a Palafin t-shirt (that alone terrified me...) and a Mimikyu cosplayer.\n\n## The Playoffs\n\n### Round 1\n\nMy first match was against Chris Marr. His team was a hyper-offensive team. It had 2 main strategies; 1: use Beat Up with Maushold on the Annihilape to increase its power for Rage Fist, and 2: Tailwind with Murkrow, and sweep with Iron Moth, Flutter Mane, and Tyranitar. Overall, this match-up was good for me, but I just couldn't do anything. I made some bad plays, and lost the set 2-0. I hadn't gotten warmed up, so I played pretty badly.\n![](Articles%20images/ChrisMarr.png)\n\n### Round 2\n\nThe next match was against Matthew Robinson, someone who had flown in from Melbourne. His team was a full Trick Room team. He always started off with his Armarouge and Indeedee, and always used Trick Room. I couldn't do anything to stop it, and looking back, there's nothing I could've done. His team was just too good, and it was a really bad match-up. I lost the set, 2-0. Again, I still wasn't fully warmed up, but even if I was, I don't think I could've won\n![](Articles%20images/MatthewRobinson.png)\n\n### Round 3\n\nMy third match was against Zack Stalker, another Trick Room user. However, he also had some fast Pok√©mon in the back, like Hydreigon, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle. I still hadn't fully warmed up, but was getting into my groove. I played way better this match, but I still couldn't win. I lost the set, 2-1.\n![](Articles%20images/ZackStalker.png)\n\nI was feeling pretty down at this point. I had gone 3 losses, 0 wins, and I really didn't want to lose any more. Kat was on 2 wins 1 loss, and Preston was also on 3 losses, 0 wins. We all felt really bad, and resolved to win our next matches.\n\n### Round 4\n\nMy next match was against James Powell, a Perth local who had participated in a few local tournaments. His team was a pretty standard team, with 3 support mons, and 3 strong offence mons. He always lead with Iron Hands and Gothitelle. I deduced that he would double Fake Out on the first turn, so I Tera-Ghost'd my Iron Moth, and become immune to it. He did this in both rounds, and I took advantage. I made some pretty good plays, and won the set 2-0.\n![](Articles%20images/JamesPowell.png)\n\n### Round 5\n\nMy fifth match was against a Chinese player named Jiangyue Chen. His team was a stall team, and was based on 1 major strategy: Mortal Spin with Glimmora or Salt cure with Garganacl, and just Protect/Spiky Shield, or bring in some bulky mons like Dondozo, Corviknight, or Iron Hands. My team was really bad against his team, but Glimmora and Kingambit carried, and I made some good plays. I won the set, 2-0.\n![](Articles%20images/jiangyuechen.png)\n\n### Round 6\n\nThe next match was against Jackson Lee Kong, another Perth local about my age. He was kind enough to give me his team. His team was a very offensive team, much like mine. His main strategies were:\n1. Using Scope Lens and Focus Energy to hit Critical hits, and ignore stat drops\n2. Use Iron Bundle and Weavile in tandem with each other, as Assurance has 120 base power when the target is hit. He could use Icy Wind and Assurance to sweep teams\n3. Just using all of his mons to provide offensive pressure\nI was pretty used to offensive teams, so I didn't have too much trouble. I will say this though: He included Weavile because it was his favourite Pok√©mon, so I don't care what anyone says, that man is **BASED**.\n![](Articles%20images/JacksonLeeKong.png)\n\n### Round 7\n\nBy now, I'm feeling pretty good. I've evened out my losses and wins, and am now at 3 wins, 3 losses. My last match will decide my ranking. Determined to win, I go into the 7th round.\n\nIt's the Palafin guy. Oh my days, his team was so good. His team was another hyper-offensive team that I didn't match up well against. I won the first set by manoeuvring well. He took the 2nd set by taking advantage of my Pok√©mon choices. In the third set, I was feeling pretty nervous. I didn't want to have a bad win:lose ratio, but it was my last match, so I wanted to have some fun. In the past, I always lead with Iron Moth and Flutter Mane, and Terastallised my Flutter Mane, and it worked pretty well. The thing is, he always lead with Iron Bundle. I knew that he was going to Hydro Pump into the Iron Bundle like he did in Game 2, and this would OHKO it. I could've protected Iron Bundle and attacked with Flutter Mane, and in retrospect, this was the safest thing to do. But I didn't want to do that. I thought, \"What if Hydro Pump missed?\". I took a 20% chance that it would miss, and based my whole strategy off that. The first turn comes. His Iron Bundle uses Hydro Pump. The seconds tick by....and he misses Hydro Pump. My Iron Bundle uses Acid Spray on his Flutter Mane, and I Terastallise my Flutter Mane, use Dazzling Gleam, and OHKO both his Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. He brings out Tyranitar and Arcanine, but the sheer force of my hyper-offensive team overwhelm him. I win the set and the round, 2-1.\n![](Articles%20images/DimitriKoziaris.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, considering that I was against adults that flew in from all over the country, I think I did rather well. I placed 55th out of 113 participants, and had a Round win to loss ratio of 4:3, and a Set win to loss ratio of 9:7. I finished with 12 points, and got a participation price of a \"Boss's Orders\" Pok√©mon Regionals Card, and a Regidrago playmat. I didn't manage to get into Day 2, but I still had a ton of fun.\n\nI had a great time there. I met some new people and made some new friends, and everyone there was so nice. Never once did I encounter a bad sport. I would 100% do this again, and would recommend anyone who is able to, to do so as well.","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/04-08-2023-the-deepest-darkest-dungeon":{"title":"04-08-2023 The deepest darkest dungeon","content":"\n[go

Hence as the riemann hypothesis can either be true or not true, it follows the statement is always true as required. furthermore if you consider that the litmus molecule is blue after having ionised a single hydrogen, one realises that the combustion of said organic molecule results in a redox reaction between the organic substance and oxygen, which is contrary to the expected halogen displacement reaction, hence one takes the partial derivative and can thus prove that we are intelligent\n\n**jonathan**: ah, i see your argument, and raise a counterpoint. i believe that if you take into account the tragedy of the commons and its activation state, by analysing the enthalpy created by the infinite path of a unit vector, you can thus conclude that despite the enthalpy created, one‚Äôs statement can be inherently false. furthermore, if you look at the unit vector created by the air resistance of the sound waves, one may see that the unit vector gradually dissipates over time due to energy absorbance, which is contrary to our statement that the unit vector‚Äôs path is infinite, thus one takes the combination and permutation of all factors and can thus conclude that there is a slight chance that we are not, in fact, intelligent, and perhaps actually idiots\n\n**ed**: that is potentially a case, however i feel that you are missing the point, and may be missing a few cases. for example, consider the case that we are averaging over¬†~~95~~92 in methods, which is true. hence it follows as people who average¬†~~95~~92 are smart people , we are thus smart as required. i understand your reasoning for using the classic unit vector proof, however i do believe that if you consider the arctan of the segment and extrapolates this value into the complex plane, projecting this data through the triangle inequality ends up suggesting that we are infact human beings, which is a key determinant in us being smart. if we take this a step further and take the nested root of i, using feynmann parametization, can conclude that there is a 7C5/8C5 probability that we are intelligence, it follows that if we are humans, and there is a 7C5/8C5 probability that we are intelligence, one can conclude that there is a high likelihood that we are intelligence people. i do hope you get better at exploring your proofs, perhaps consider adding a galvanic cell into your brain and then increase the hydroxide concentration to favour the reactive process of the lead-acid battery accumulator.\n\n**jonathan**: your point is quite valid, however i have noticed a fatal flaw. the kinetic energy combined with the potential energy and normal force creates an overflow of dispersion forces, meaning that the electrons will move more rapidly. furthermore, hydrogen bonding will also occur at the equilibrium point, meaning that the Sartre hypothesis will prove correct, that our lives are meaningless without purpose, and from this we can conclude, that, by choosing 8 objects from 6, we can further support our point. another point of interest will occur when you consider the inelastic collision created by the collision of our 2 arguments. by analysing your findings, you will discover that the energy created after the collision is greater than the energy in the system before. this means that the process is energetically favourable and thus is soluble in the liquid of human thought. thus, by passing this through the darwinism theory, we can thus conclude that some part of your argument may be partly false.\n\n**ed**: i see what you mean, however as the legendary erik satie once said, ‚ÄúDe mani√®re √† obtenir un creux‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúso as to be a hole‚Äù. I feel that you have fallen into the classic trap, the hole if you will, of considering the average kinetic energy of ideal gas particles, and applying this to elastic collisions, which would be correct if we were to assume that we live in a 3-dimensional universe, however as we made the question we cannot simply assume such a bold claim. your thesis has to account for more than just a 3-dimensional reality, and thus i propose we use string theory to consider the many possible dimensions possible. furthermore, your logic falls apart when you consider elastic collisions, as we know from the author of the book ‚Äúphysics‚Äù, dr waters has said that elastic collisions only occur for ideal gas particles, and as humans while we may consist of some gasses, we simply cannot state that humans themselves are gas particles, as we are actually made of multiple substances, that transfer electrons through the process known as redox, i.e. reduction and oxidation, and this process yield thats we must derive a compromise function for the manufacturing of ammonia in the equilibrium system n2 + 3h2 \u003c‚Äì\u003e 2nh3. we know this reaction is exothermic, hence we must find a point where x = e^ln(5), it follows that the compromise is a moderate temperature and a high pressure, which further implies that not only are we moving close to the speed of sound, we do so by emitting intelligence rays, hence we are a point source of intelligence, so we are thus intelligent beings.\n\n**jonathan**: your point most definitely is well defined. however, as the great strategist Sun Tzu once said, ‚ÄúSu«íy«íu de zh√†nzhƒìng d≈çu ji√†nl√¨ z√†i qƒ´pi√†n zhƒ´ sh√†ng‚Äù, or ‚Äúall war is based on deceit‚Äù. you see, i had left out a crucial fact in my argument, a slight amount of deceit, if you will, which would be, that if you consider the theory of relativity, and the homogenous mixture created from this, and show that the spherical wavelets created from this are actually not tangent to the new wavefront, and instead propagate parallel to the wavefront, and in fact touch at all angles. one can thus reason from this that the highest point of the parabola will intersect where the activation energy required with a catalyst is equal to the square root of the added mass of the reactants, and from this we can gain a net value for x, and thus determine the domain. futhermore, if you consider the ramifications of the animalia kingdom, you will find that in the translation, when the messenger RNA is sent, another particle is actually ejected, known as confusin, or the ‚Äústupid‚Äù protein. this potentially activates inside ones brain, and renders one argument as incoherent, thus your argument could potentially be incorrect. i would like to conclude with a statement, that we are now chilling, bing chlling if you will.","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/12-05-2023-spec-problems-i-could-solve-that-edward-couldnt":{"title":"12-05-2023 Spec problems I could solve that edward couldn't","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\n## Proof by Counterexample\n\n$$\\forall{n}\\in \\mathbb{N}; 2n^2-4n+31\\in P$$\nFor this, we must show that there exists a natural number $n$, such that $2n^2-4m+31$ is not a prime number, i.e. is a composite number. We must thus use proof by counterexample for this. All single-digit natural numbers come to mind, but we can see that they all equal prime numbers if we input them into the equation. 11, 12 and 13 also do not work, so we use 14. From this, we can see that if: \n$$n=14\\therefore 2n^2-4n+31 = 2(14)^2-4(14)+31=2(196)-42+31=381$$\n381 is divisible by 3, as they add to give a multiple of 3.

Determine, with justification, the length CD.**\n\nSo, we know what the radius is (12.6 cm). However, what does this actually tell us? From this, we can deduce that length *AB, AD, AC, BD, and BC* are all equal to 12.6 cm, as they are all radii. Furthermore, by drawing the line *AB* into the diagram, we now have a right angled triangle, like so.\n\n![](Articles%20images/GeometricProof2.png)\n\nIn addition, we can see that the chord *CD* bisects AB, so now we know that one side of the triangle is 12.6 cm, and the other is 6.3 cm (12.6 cm divided by 2).\n\nFrom this, we use the Pythagoras theorem, or $a^2+b^2=c^2$, to show that:\n$$6.3^2+c^2=12.6^2 \\therefore c=\\sqrt{12.6^2-6.3^2},c=10.91$$\n, where c is equal to half the length of chord $CD$.\n\nSo now we know that c is equal to 10.91. However, we know that this is only half of chord $CD$, so we must multiply it by 2. And through this, we deduce that $2 \\times 2\\times 10.91=21.82$ . Thus, the length of chord *CD* is 21.82 cm.","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/13-05-2023-a-bill-of-town":{"title":"13-05-2023 A bill of town","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\n## Preface\n\nPresently we live in an assumed democracy.

The mayor has no other powers, and does not have the right to remove members of the town.\n\n## Election\n\nA snap election may be initiated at any time, but after a snap election fails the mayor gains a 5 day immunity. 3 successive failed snap election results in a 1 month immunity. This requires 1 person to challenge the mayor, with the support of at least 4 other people. Following this, the members of the town will participate in a vote between the challenger and the mayor. The challenger must get a strict majority (\u003e 50%, absentees are considered votes for the current mayor). If this is attained, the mayor must hand over ownership to the challenger. However, as the former mayor, they enjoy certain privileges until the next mayor after is elected, namely:\n\n-   Immunity from being kicked\n-   Immunity from being muted/server channel restriction (excluding cases in which they breach code of conduct e.g. spamming nsfw images)[^2]\n-   The privileges given to a standard member of the town Note that attempting to circumvent this immunity is outlawed and immediately returns ownership to the previous owner (for example, by immediately transferring ownership, kicking them, and then regaining it), or by a collective consideration of the previous discord server being illegitimate.\n\n## Anti-bickering\n\nIn order to prevent deadlock due to splintered factionalism in the town, and to make sure a firm ruling on what makes rules ‚Äúequal‚Äù or ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to each other, a town speaker[^3]¬†will be elected, once again by a 50% majority in a vote. This will be decided like¬†~~the french election~~¬†a multi-stage electoral process, where candidates may initially run for speaker, and where consecutive rounds will occur where the candidate that receives the lowest amount of votes is removed from the election (This is essentially the process for the Tory leadership elections, cause why not its funny).\n\nThe roles of the speaker will be¬†**mostly ceremonial**,¬†_with the exception_¬†that they have the final say on whether a proposed vote is too similar to any prior votes in the above mentioned time-frame that would prevent such a proposal from being voted on.\n\nAny votes related to the speaker, i.e. votes of no confidence, cannot be rejected by the speaker. However after two successive failed votes against the speaker, the speaker gains a 1 week immunity. In that 1 week period no votes related to the speaker may be proposed.\n\n\n## An important note\n\n\nBefore we go into the declaration of intent, I want to clarify how changes can be made. In a legal (if you consider there to even be laws) sense, anything related to the democratic function (the previous headings, i.e. from voting to anti-bickering inclusive) cannot be changed via vote, unless a 80% majority agrees to a proposed change. For anything else, i.e. adding things below that are unrelated to the democracy of the town, the above rules apply.\n\n\n## Declaration of intent\n\nThere was an intention in making the town, and while I wasn‚Äôt exactly the founder of the static site group, per se, I will acknowledge Christian as the original founder, I do believe (fact check me if I‚Äôm wrong) that I did come up with the original idea for the ‚Äútown‚Äù, i.e. a collection of individuals who all have static sites, with the goal of collaboration and surviving ‚Äúthe desert‚Äù in mind.\n\nHowever, due to the current situation, I feel it is the right time to make some clarifications about the actual goals of the town, its fundamental tenets, and its requirements for membership.\n\n### Purpose\n\nTo foster a community of individuals who individually own a online medium for the distribution of notes. The goal is to exist independently from external entities and help each other cultivate their own notes.\n\n### Tenets\n\n- Town members co-exist as equals: as soon as someone becomes a town member, they have equal rights and say in the town.\n- While mild slander is acceptable, defamatory comments are frowned upon, and votes may be held to reprimand people who excessively use libel/slander through their notes medium.\n- NSFW content, as well as content that unduly harasses people or makes them uncomfortable, is banned. This includes any sexually explicit, violent, graphic, or offensive content (and especially inappropriate images from¬†~~redacted~~).\n\n## Requirements for membership\n\nIndividuals who individually own a online medium for the distribution of notes are applicable to be members.\n\nThis is including, and not limited to:\n\n-   Jekyll websites\n-   Quartz (Jekyll with modifications) websites\n-   Zola (also Jekyll with modification) websites\n-   Wix websites\n-   Notion users\n\nThese notes need to be¬†**relatively**¬†accessible. I.e. if it is physically and theoretically possible to access them, then they meet the requirement. Town members can take down their websites temporarily (up to 5 days). In order to join the town, members must submit an application (doesn‚Äôt need to be too complicated), and members must vote on it. A simple majority will suffice, as long as most people vote and more people are in favour than against. If there are 3 or more people against allowing a person to join, the town will engage in a discussion in order to make the vote as unanimous as possible.\n\n## Removing members and reprimanding\n\nTo forcefully remove a member, a vote must be held that reaches a supportive majority of 70%, and a proper reason must be given (e.g. violation of the rules). If this is for joke purposes, the member¬†_must_¬†be timed-out and/or restricted to a few channels via a removable role. Members can leave at any time, but those who do are not necessarily immediately reinstated if they change their mind.\n\nTo mute or temporarily suspend the membership of an individual, a vote must garner a 60% majority. This kind of ‚Äúcensor‚Äù vote cannot be held against either the mayor or the speaker.\n\n[^1]: The mayor can be called the mayo if you want to call them the mayo\n[^2]: If additional restrictions are to be placed on the mayor in future, they must be voted on within the same vote to remove the mayor\n[^3]: The town speaker cannot be the mayor. There is an obvious conflict of interest","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/14-05-2023-a-funny-conversation-i-found":{"title":"14-05-2023 A funny conversation I found","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\nreplacing it with people in the town because it was funny\n\n**Jonathan:** Would you guys be there for me if I was going through something?  \n**Ed:** no. \n**Christian:** nope.  \n**Dasindu:** absolutely not  \n**Jonathan:** Hahahahahaha  \n**Christian**: I hope it sucks, whatever you're going through  \n**Jonathan**: I hope it sucks? oh, what the fuck!  \n**Dasindu**: I hope it emotionally scars you for the rest of your life  \n**Ed**: I hope you reach out to me so I can ignore you  \n**Dasindu**: hahahahahahahahahahahahaha  \n**Christian**: I can't wait to go to your funeral knowing I could have changed that outcome  \n**Ed**: hahahahahahahahahahahahaha  \n**Dasindu**: oh fuck  \n**Christian**: oh brother  \n**Jonathan:** ffffuck man what the hell  \n**Ed:** shit got real real quick  \n**Jonathan:** I was just asking if you would be there for me","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/16-05-2023-a-few-books-i-recommend-reading":{"title":"A few books I would recommend reading","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\nnot including manga, I'll highlight those later\n\n## The Inheritance Cycle, by Christopher Paolini\n\nThis is a book, reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but in my opinion, better. The author has composed their own language, and it's obvious that he has put a lot of thought into worldbuilding. This story is set in a dystopian fantasy, where an evil king rules over the land of Alagaesia. The Dragon Riders, the independent group that fought for peace, is now extinct. Enter, Eragon, a farm boy, who mysteriously gained a dragon egg, and is now destined to defeat the dark king.\n\nI would highly recommend reading this. It's a complicated read, the writing syntax is much like Lord of the Rings. Possibly my favourite book series of all time. It has 4 books: Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance. There's also another side-story, called \"The Fork, the Witch and the Worm\". \n\n## To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, by Christopher Paolini\n\nI really like this author. In this, he writes a science fiction book, set in the far future, where humanity has expanded beyond the solar system, across the galaxy. Kira Naver√©z comes into contact with an extraterrestrial organism which bonds to her, and finds herself in the midst of an intergalactic war for possession of the alien.\n\nAgain, his writing syntax is very mature, and it's a brilliant book. However, his books are quite long, but his worldbuilding is insane.\n\n## The Karen M. McMagnus Series\n\nShe's a murder mystery/crime fiction writer, and her books are so good. They have so many plot twists that you don't end up seeing until they actually happen. It's a brilliant series, and her characterisation of everyone is brilliant, as it perfectly highlights the mental issues and problems teenagers encounter every day. I highly recommend this.\n\n## Lock the Doors, by Vincent Ralph\n\nSo. Good. Again, another murder mystery, where the main character (MC) moves into a new town, and immediately notices something wrong with his house. The perfect family that used to live there is a bit strange, and there's a lot of things that he isn't told. The plot in this is very engaging, and it's such a good read.\n\n## Lost Stars, by Claudia Grey\n\nThis is a Star Wars book, with a mature writing style. The book follows an Imperial recruit who becomes disillusioned with the Empire and its methods. It provides another side to the story, and is a very good read.\n\n## The Alchemyst Series, a.k.a. the Secrets of Nicholas Flamel, by Michael Scott\n\nThis represents cultural mythology and legends in a new form, and is a brilliant series. There's so much mystery and lore, and the author does a great job of portraying mythological figures from different cultures.\n\n## The Dandelion Dynasty, by Ken Liu\n\nAgain, a fictional world, with 4 books. It's a very long read, so you'll have to be invested. The story follows a boy, who rebels against the current emperor, and then has to struggle with the troubles of the aristocracy, e.g. corruption. It's a very good read, but a bit tedious at times. It's also very sad.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/17-05-2023-some-thoughts-on-life":{"title":"17-05-2023 Some thoughts on life","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\nI'm high on anger and no sleep.\n\nRight now, life isn't as great as it could be.\n\nMy friends are controlling my social life.\n\nMy parents are controlling my school life.\n\nI basically have nothing to do.\n\nDon't let other people decide what you want to do.

This is quite an interesting image, isn't it. My best friend Ajay Bisnath, Student Councillor of Perth Modern, has started to use Obsidian. \n\nAjay here is trying to make a table using the Advanced Tables Plugin. Ajay has been using Obsidian for two weeks and has already discovered community plugins. Ajay thinks he's hot sh-t. And Ajay is brimming with the confidence of a 10 year old who just walked into a national chess tournament.\n\nAjay found this problem here, and asks Jonathan for help. He says, \"Golly gee darn, there's no way he can solve it!\" \nJonathan takes a look at it, and tells him to do the table again. Ajay, outraged at the 5 minutes that he lost from making the table, challenges Jonathan to complete it faster than him. Amazingly, Jonathan does.\n\n![](Articles%20images/table.png)\n\nAjay is amazed, and then finds out why his table wasn't working. Embarrassed, he doesn't tell Jonathan. \n\nJonathan immediately notices and then proceeds to slam him on how he didn't notice. He put the title above the table, which ruins the plugin.\n\nAjay leaves the voice chat. Jonathan starts to dance.\n\nAjay rejoins, and then proceeds to say, \"At least we know what happened,\" to which Jonathan responds to \"We? You didn't do jack sh-t.\" \nAjay then says, \"At least now we can fix our mistake,\" where Jonathan goes, \"Our? It's your fault!\"\n\nThen Ajay proceeds to start playing Putt Party with Jonathan, where he gets his ass handed to him.\n\nBye!\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/24-07-2023-taco-cat-goat-cheese-pizza":{"title":"24-07-2023 Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\ni'm the best\n\ntaco\n\ncat\n\ngoat\n\ncheese\n\npizza\n\ni'm actually cracked at this game\n\nhighly recommend\n\nfun fact: tacocat is a palindrome\n\nthis is my favourite one:\n\na man, a plan, a canal, panama","lastmodified":"2023-08-20T05:01:51.635397139Z","tags":[]},"/NotTheTagArticles/25-05-2023-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go":{"title":"25-05-2023 Should I stay or should I go","content":"\n[go back](Articles.md)\n\n~~Like the hit song \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" by The Clash?~~\n\nBut seriously.\n\nI'm in a bit of a pickle right now.
