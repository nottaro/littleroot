## Things you are assumed to know already
- Angle sum theorems for triangles and quadrilaterals
- Properties of intersecting lines
	- Congruence of vertically opposite angles
- Relationships involving angles in parallel lines with a transversal
	- Corresponding, alternate, interior
- Isosceles angle theorem
	- Angles opposite to the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are also equal.
- Triangle congruence and similarity "tests"
- In a triangle, an exterior angle is the sum of the 2 remote interior angles

## Circles
- Circle: set of all points at a given distance $r$ from a given point $O$ called the centre
