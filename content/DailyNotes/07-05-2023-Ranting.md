My friends have a plan involving me. I was told that I would have to make a big decision.

However.

Nobody is telling me what is going on. They weren't even meant to tell me about this "decision". They're deliberately keeping me in the dark.

What's the point of getting me to make a decision without any context?

I'm the one who's being affected by this, but no-one is helping. No-one cares.

I'm considering just never talking to them again.

Should I?

I've asked again multiple times. Each time, they just say no.

This is not fair.

This is not right.

Hiding this from me does not make any sense.

I feel lost. I feel confused. You are not helping me in any sense by keeping this from me. 


If you're reading this, "friends", please contact me, and let me know what the hell is going on.

That's all.
