### Circadian rhythm
- Body's day and night cycle
- Repeats over 24 hours
- Tells us to go to sleep
- Is governed by natural light

## Homeostasis
- Maintenance of a constant internal environment
- Some of the major internal conditions that need to be maintained at optimal levels include:
	- Blood glucose levels
	- Blood water levels
	- Body temperature
	- Blood oxygen levels
- Body tries to stay at constant temperature (37.5˚ C)
	- Optimal temperature for chemical reactions in cells
- To keep temperature the same it must balance the heat loss and heat gain
- Our bodies use behavioural and physiological methods to control temperature
	- Behavioural: Change clothes, cold drink, seek cool place, reducing activity
	- Physiological: Sweating, goose bumps, shivering, increasing activity

### Negative Feedback Loop
- Components
	- Stimulus
		- Change in internal environment
	- Receptor
		- Detects change
	- Modulator (coordinator)
		- Control centre that processes information from receptor and sends information to effector
	- Message
		- Message that is sent from modulator/coordinator to effector
	- Effector
		- Part of body that carries out response
	- Response
		- Process that occurs in effector
	- Feedback
		- Change in internal conditions
- Most homeostatic control mechanisms display negative feedback
- Negative feedback is when the response is opposite to the stimulus and returns the body to its set point

## Temperature

- Homeothermic - 37˚ C
	- Need for a constant body temperature
	- Chemical reactions
	- Enzymes (denaturation)
	- Nerve malfunction
	- Death
	- 30-32-37-42-44
- Variation in body temperature due to
	- External influences
	- Rate of activity
	- Biorhythms - 24 hr ($\downarrow$ morning, $\uparrow$afternoon)
	- Menstrual cycle ($\uparrow$ 2nd half due to hormones)

### Heat Production
- Heat is produced in the body by:
	- Normal cellular metabolism/respiration
	- Action of muscles during movement and exercise
	- Shivering (involuntary muscle contractions)
	- Hormonally increasing metabolic rate (up to 40 x)
- Heat can also be gained from the environment by exposing yourself to the sun or another heat source

### Heat Loss
- Heat is lost through the skin and mucous membranes by
	- CCR
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation
	- Evaporation of sweat
	- Heat can also be lost from the body by exposing yourself to cold mediums

#### Receptors
- The receptors for temperature are called thermoreceptors
- 2 types
	- Cold
	- Heat
- Thermoreceptors send nerve impulses to brain (hypothalamus)

#### Modulator and Message
- Modulator or control centre for temperature is in the brain (hypothalamus)
- Sends nervous impulses(electrical messages to effectors)

#### Effectors, Response and Feedback
- Effector
	- Part of the body that carries out a response to counteract the effect of the stimulus
- Response
	- The process that occurs in the effector
- Feedback
	- The change in internal conditions as a result of the action of the effectors

##### Effectors and Response: Skin
- Blood vessels carry heat to the skin from the body core
- Diameter of blood vessels to the skin is controlled by nerves that cause vasoconstriction and vasodilation
- Vasodilation occurs to increase heat loss through CCR
- Vasoconstriction occurs to decrease heat loss through CCR
- Evaporation of water from the skin and lungs, accounts for a considerable proportion of heat loss
- Piloerection (goosebumps)
	- Hair follicles raise hair from surface to trap a warm layer of air (little effect)

##### Effectors and Response: Brain
- Cold conditions
	- Brain $\rightarrow$ Changed behaviour, e.g. $\downarrow$ SA(surface area) huddling in a ball, extra clothes = $\downarrow$Heat Loss
	- Brain $\rightarrow$ Changed behaviour, e.g. voluntary activity = $\uparrow$ ­Heat production
	- Brain $\rightarrow$ Changed behaviour, e.g. heat-seeking behaviour = $\uparrow$ ­Heat production
- Hot conditions
	- Brain $\rightarrow$ Changed behaviour, e.g. ­$\uparrow$ SA by changing shape = $\uparrow$ ­Heat loss
	- Brain $\rightarrow$ Changed behaviour, e.g. $\downarrow$ Voluntary actions = $\downarrow$ Heat production
	- Brain $\rightarrow$ Changed behaviour, e.g. cool-seeking/heat-avoiding behaviour = $\downarrow$ Heat gain, $\uparrow$ ­heat loss

##### Effectors and Response: Muscles
- Skeletal muscles $\rightarrow$ Shivering = rapid muscle contraction = $\uparrow$ ­Heat production
