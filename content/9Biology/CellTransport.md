## Cell Requirements
- To enable normal functioning all cells in the human body need to be in a relatively stable environment
- Some like brain and retinal cells are very susceptible to even slight variations in glucose, oxygen and temperature
- Other cells such as skin cells are able to cope with a much wider range of conditions e.g. temperature
- One of the 'roles' of the body systems is to maintain a continual supply of the materials needed and a continued removal of waste materials
- Body systems work together to make sure that the cellular environment is kept constant
- Called homeostasis
- Systems operate in such a way that if a particular factor becomes too high or too low they will function to return the factor to its best or optimal level

## Cell Membrane Structure
- Composed mainly of lipids and proteins
- Arranged into 2 layers that make up the single membrane
- Called a bilayer
- Substances and molecules move through the membrane in different ways
- How they are moved depends on their size and if they are organic or inorganic
- Very small molecules e.g. oxygen can pass through the small gaps between the lipids
- Fat soluble such as alcohol and steroid hormones can diffuse across the membrane by 'dissolving' into the lipid (fat)
- Proteins are embedded through the membrane and they carry out most of the functions of the membrane
- Divided into 2 types
	- Integral proteins bridge the 2 sides of the membranes
	- Peripheral proteins embedded in the outside of the membrane

### Transport Across the Cell Membrane
- Cell membranes are described as being differentially permeable
- Allow some ions and molecules to pass through
- Restrict movement of others, usually based on size
- Differentially permeable membranes are also known as semi-permeable or selectively permeable membranes

### Passive and Active Processes
- Materials may pass through cell membrane in a number of different ways
- Some transfer mechanisms are passive processes which means there is no requirement to spend energy
- Passive processes will occur in both living and dead cells and are almost impossible to prevent
	- Diffusion
	- Osmosis
	- Facilitated Diffusion
- Active processes require the cell's energy for the transfer to occur. It only occurs in living cells
	- Cytosis
	- Active Transport

#### Diffusion
- Movement of molecules from area of high concentration to area of low concentration
- Only occurs when there is a difference in concentration between 2 areas (concentration gradient)
- Passive Process
- Occur in almost any circumstance where cells can move, it does not need a cell membrane
