- Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious **food** that meets their dietary needs and **food** preferences for an active and healthy life.

### Anthropogenic Biomes
- Homo sapiens left Africa between 125000 and 60000 years ago
- As they moved across the world they adapted to different biomes
- Only remained in a biome if it could provide sufficient food for survival
- Some civilisations have disappeared because they over exploited the biome by overusing scarce water and  over grazing crops, leading to soil erosion and declining food supplies
- Most terrestrial biomes have been altered by humans fore food and settlement. These actions have altered natural systems, productivity cycles and energy flows
- Altering biomes for agriculture can have a long term effect on an area's ecological processes

### Biomes: Net primary productivity
- Net primary productivity is the rate at which ecosystem producers capture and store energy as biomass
- NPP indicates plant productivity and measures the rate at which plants can convert carbon dioxide and water into energy
- When energy is exchanged from plants to animals or from animals to animals through consumption, this is known as a food chain
- Main abiotic controls of NPP are temperature, radiation and water
- Over time, the NPP of ecosystems changes due to natural and anthropogenic factors such as fire, wind, insect and pests outbreaks, changes in soil nutrients, changes in light levels and changes in climatic/atmospheric conditions
- Anthropogenic changes to the land have resulted in changed NPP
- As people continue to alter Earth's biomes, scientists question how the terrestrial and aquatic biomes will continue to supply food for an increasing population

### Changing biomes for food
- Since prehistoric times, people have been hunting and gathering food in their environments
- Over 4000 years ago, the Agricultural Revolution moved humans from foraging for food to farming food
