- Electrostatics: Organisation of the parts of an atom has electrons orbiting a large central nucleus of nucleons(neutrons and protons)
- If there is an unbalanced number of protons(positive carriers) compared to electrons (negative carriers) then the ion is called a charged particle

### Charging by friction
- If you rub 2 objects together, one object is uncharged because it has equal amounts of positive and negative charges
- Some electrons move from one object to the other
- Now one object is more positively charged than the other
- Overall effect of these charged particles produces a force
- If the electrical charge is "held" on the surface of a material it is referred to as static electricity
- At the moment the electricity is still
- This charge cannot move through out the material if it is an insulator
- Charge objects exert an electrical force
- Similar charges repel each other and opposite charges attract
- Electrical static charge can be produced in 2 ways: by friction and induction
- The attractive forces which keep the electrons (negative) close to the nucleus(positive) can easily be overcome
- The electrons have relatively low mass compared to the nucleons and therefore it is only ever the electrons which can be transferred throughout a material or from one material to another
