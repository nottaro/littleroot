### Voltage
- A force that pushes the current through
- Measured in volts

### Resistance
- Friction that impedes the flow of current through the circuit
- Measured in Ohms
- Lower the resistance the easier it is for the electrons to pass through a material
- Can be used to convert electrical energy into useful light energy and wasted heat energy (voltage drop)
- Factors of resistance
	- Material of wire
	- Length of wire
	- Thickness of wire

### Electric Circuit
- Path travelled by the electrons to deliver the energy is called an electric circuit
- And break in the circuit will stop the flow of electrons
- The current goes from the negative to positive end of the battery and the circuit should start and end at the battery
- Circuit symbols are used to show an electric circuit

### Simple Circuit
- Series Circuit
	- All resistors are placed in a row
	- 1 path for electricity
	- 1 light goes out and the circuit is broken
- Parallel circuit
	- Many paths for electricity
	- 1 light goes out and the others stay on

### Series Circuit
- Current flowing through each resistor is the same
- Current = $I_{total} = I_1=I_2=…$
- Voltage across each resistor is different
- Resistance = $R_{total} = R_1+R_2+…$

### Parallel circuit
- Voltage across each resister is same
- Voltage = $V_{total} = V_1=V_2=…$
- To calculate total resistance in parallel circuit, $\frac{1}{R_{total}}+ \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + …$


### Cell and Battery
