# 12 Principles of Green Chemistry
1. *Prevention*
	1. **It is better to prevent waste than treat or clean up waste after it has been created**
	2. Minimise waste
2. *Atom economy*
	1. **Synthetic materials should be designed to maximise incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product**
	2. Maximise efficiency of the reaction
	3. What atoms of the reaction are incorporated into the final design of the product(s), and what atoms are wasted?
3. *Less Hazardous Chemical Syntheses*
	1. **Where practicable, synthetic materials should be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment**
	2. Limit hazards of products and materials
	3. Note: this implies it may not be possible/practical to avoid certain toxic materials
4. *Designing Safer Chemicals*
	1. **Chemical products should be designed to preserve efficacy of function while reducing toxicity**
	2. Minimising toxicity while simultaneously maintaining function and efficacy
	3. Efficacy: ability to produce a desired/intended product
5. *Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries*
	1. **The use of auxiliary substances (e.g. solvents, separation agents, etc) should be made unnecessary wherever possible, and innocuous when used** 
	2. Minimise use of auxiliary substances, and wherever used, use non-harmful substances
	3. Solvents and separation agents do matter, we just want to limit hazards/risks
	4. Solvents account for 50-80% of the mass in a standard batch chemical operation 
6. *Design for Energy Efficiency*
	1. **Energy requirements should be recognised for their environmental and  economic impacts and should be minimised. Synthetic methods should be conducted at ambient temperatures and pressures**
	2. Use ideal conditions for synthesis
	3. Maximise energy efficiency
	4. Usually, no consideration is given to temperature/pressure for energy requirements
	5. Thus, we need to consider the energy requirements and try to maximise efficiency
7. *Use of Renewable Feedstocks*
	1. **A raw material or feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting whenever technically and economically practicable**
	2. Use sustainable materials for synthesis
8. *Reduce Derivatives*
	1. **Unnecessary derivatization(use of blocking groups, protection/deprotection, temporary modification of physical/chemical processes) should be minimised and avoided if possible, because such steps require additional reagents and can generate waste**
	2. i.e. keep process as simple as possible
	3. Minimise/prevent unnecessary reactions to reduce waste/use of reagents
	4. Reduce use of derivatives and protect groups in the synthesis of target molecules
	5. Derivatization: A chemical compound is converted into a product of similar chemical structure, called a derivative
9. *Catalysis* 
	1. **Catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are superior to stoichiometric reagents**
	2. Concept of efficiency shifts from maximising yield to minimising waste
	3. Prioritise waste over yield
	4. Use catalysts to speed up reaction, instead of adding more reagents
10. *Design for Degradation*
	1. **Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their function, they break down into innocuous degradation products and do not persist in the environment**
	2. Optimise the commercial function of a product while minimising its hazard and risk
11. *Real-time Analysis for Pollution Prevention*
	1. **Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to allow for real-time, in-process monitoring, and control prior to the formation of hazardous substances**
	2. Real-time feedback/process analysis for the safe and efficient operations of chemical plants/reactions
12. *Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident Prevention*
	1. **Substances and the form of a substance used in a chemical process should be chosen to minimise the potential for chemical accidents, including releases, explosions, and fires**
	2. Laboratory safety
	3. Minimise potential safety hazards
	4. Substances and the form of a substance used in a chemical process should be chosen to mimise the potential for chemical accidents

### Atom Economy:
$$\frac{\text{M[desired product]} \times 100 \%}{\text{M[reactants]}}$$

# Ethanol Production

**Both processes are exothermic**

### Fermentation
- Metabolic process where organisms convert carbohydrates (sugars, starch) into alcohols/acids
- Starts with glucose and ends with ethanol and carbon dioxide
- Conditions
	- Room pressure and ambient temperature (~37˚ C)
	- 3-5 pH 
	- Enzymes as catalysts
		- Enzyme: biological catalyst
	- Oxygen is excluded from this to prevent the anaerobic respiration of sugars, and encourage the production of ethanol

1. Hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose, (isomers of $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$). This reaction is catalysed by the yeast enzyme **invertase** or **sucrase**
2. Fermentation of the glucose/fructose mixture to ethanol and carbon dioxide. This is catalysed by the yeast enzyme zymase

$$\text{Hydrolysis of sucrose via invertase/sucrase: } C_{12}H_{22}O_{11(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} \to 2C_{6}H_{12}O_{6(aq)}$$

$$\text{Fermentation via zymase: } C_{6}H_{12}O_{6(aq)} \to 2C_{2}H_{5}OH_{(aq)} + 2CO_{2(g)}$$
$$\text{Overall process via yeast enzymes: } C_{12}H_{22}O_{11(aq)} + H_{2}O \to 4C_{2}H_{5}OH_{(aq)} + 4CO_{2(g)}$$
### Extension
#### 1. Glycosis
- Breakdown of glucose into 2 pyruvate molecules
- 11 chemical reactions, breaks down sugars and releases energy in the form of ATP
- Overall products are 2 pyruvate molecules, 2 NADH (enzyme), and 2 molecules of ATP
- The pyruvate molecules are further processed in the absence of oxygen to form ethanol

$$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 2 \text{ ADP}+2P_{i} \text{ (inorganic phosphate)} + 2 \text{ NAD}^+ \to 2CH_{3}COCOO^- \text{ (pyruvate)} + 2 \text{ ATP} + 2 \text{ NADH} + 2H_{2}O + 2H^+$$
#### 2. Pyruvate to Ethanol Conversion
- Pyruvate molecules are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide
- Step 1: carboxyl group is removed and released in the form of $CO_{2}$ , producing acetaldehyde. This reaction is catalysed by pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme
- Step 2: Acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to form ethanol. The $NAD^+$ molecule/enzyme  is regenerated during this. The catalyst for this is alcohol dehydrogenase

$$\text{1. } CH_{3}COCOO^- + H^+ \to CH_{3}CHO \text{ (acetaldehyde)}+CO_{2}$$
$$\text{2. } CH_{3}CHO + NADH + H^+ \to C_{2}H_{5}OH \text{ (ethanol)} + NAD^+$$
#### 3. Overall:
$$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} \text{ (glucose)} \to 2C_{2}H_{5}OH \text{ (ethanol)} + 2CO_{2} \text{ (carbon dioxide)}$$

### Chemical Synthesis
- Produced by reacting ethene with steam
- The reaction is reversible, and the forward reaction is exothermic
- Only 5% of the ethene is reacted for every pass through the reactor, but 95% can be achieved by removing the ethanol
- Ethene is used in excess, even though water is cheaper
	- This is because of the phosphoric(V) acid, which is coated on a solid silicon dioxide support. An excess of steam results in the dilution of the catalyst, and perhaps even removal of it, as it washes off
- As the forward reaction is exothermic, a low temperature is ideal, to maximise yield.
- However, as rate requires a high temperature, a compromise temperature of 300˚ C is used
	- Produces an acceptable amount of ethanol in a very short time (5% of ethanol reacts)
- High pressure is ideal, however only a moderate pressure is used due to safety, energy and economic concerns
	- Furthermore, at high pressures, ethene polymerises to make poly-ethene
	- This produces waste, and could clog up the plant
- A catalyst of phosphoric(V) acid coated on a solid silicon dioxide support is used
	- This is to increase the rate of reaction without decreasing yield
	- Without a catalyst, the reaction is slow, such that virtually no reaction happens in a realistic amount of time
	- Catalyst ensures dynamic equilibrium is achieved as fast as possible within the short time the gases spend in the reactor
- Conditions:
	- Phosphoric acid catalyst
	- 60-70 atm (moderate pressure)
	- ~300˚ C

$$C_{2}H_{4(g)} + H_{2}O_{(g)} \rightleftharpoons CH_{3}CH_{2}OH_{(g)}$$

### Comparisons
- **Rate**
	- To maximise rate, a catalyst and moderate temperatures and pressures are utilised in the synthesis of ethanol
	- To maximise rate in fermentation, temperature of ~37 ˚C and ambient pressure is used
- **Equilibrium**
	- To shift equilibrium right, an excess of ethene is provided, and moderate pressures are used, in the synthesis of ethanol
- **Biofuel**
	- Biofuels: fuels made using living organisms or the wastes they produce
	- Thus, ethanol produced through fermentation is biofuel
	- Synthetic ethanol is not
- **12 Principles of Green Chemistry**
	- *Prevention*
		- Synthesis: the excess ethene is reacted, to minimise waste, and thus prevention is upheld
		- Fermentation: the yeast dies after a few weeks, and thus waste is created
	- *Atom Economy*
		- Synthesis: The excess ethene is reacted, to maximise the amount of reactants reacted, and thus the Atom Economy is upheld
			- Atom economy calc is 100%
		- Fermentation: Not all of the feedstock is consumed, and thus the Atom Economy is not upheld
			- Atom economy calc is 51%
		- Synthesis is preferable
	- *Less Hazardous Chemical Synthesis*
		- Synthesis: only ethanol is produced, which is flammable, and could potentially be harmful. Furthermore, a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst is used, which is corrosive
		- Fermentation: only ethanol is produced, which is flammable, and could potentially be harmful
	- *Designing Safer Chemicals*
		- Ethanol is relatively safe, in that large doses must be taken for it to be permanently harmful to anyone
		- However, small doses can cause headaches, dizziness, and in extreme cases, irritation of the eye
	- *Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries*
		- Synthesis: no harmful, extra, unnecessary substances
		- Fermentation: no harmful, extra, unnecessary substances
	- *Design for Energy Efficiency*
		- Synthesis: Only moderate temperatures and pressures are used, to conserve energy
		- Fermentation: Large amounts of heat energy are required to isolate feedstock
	- *Use of Renewable Feedstocks*
		- Synthesis: Water and ethene are not renewable
		- Fermentation: Organic waste, such as corn and starch, are renewable
	- *Reduce Derivatives*
		- Synthesis: Only necessary reactants are converted into products
		- Fermentation: Some by-products are produced, through other reactions
	- *Catalysis*
		- Synthesis: A phosphoric (V) acid catalyst on a silicon dioxide support is used
		- Fermentation: No catalyst is used
	- *Design for Degradation*
		- Ethanol is biodegradable and nontoxic
	- *Real-time Analysis for Pollution Prevention*
		- Carbon dioxide is produced by fermentation
		- No greenhouse gases are produced in the synthesis by addition of ethanol
		- However, carbon dioxide is produced from the combustion of ethanol
	- *Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident Prevention*
		- Workers have respirators, overalls, gloves, boots and safety goggles
		- Ethanol is kept in containers that are securely sealed to prevent leakage/evaporation, which are accurately labelled, and have features to prevent explosions. These are also kept in cool areas
		- When transporting ethanol, grounding/bonding procedures are present to prevent static charges
		- Ethanol should not be kept near incompatible materials
		- Regular risk assessments
		- Fire extinguishers ready in case of fire
		- Ethanol is absorbed in the case of a spill, so that it does not enter water supply
		- Monitoring/warning systems in place
		- Regular fire drills
