We want: 
- High yield (large percentage of products)
	- (100% yield is not possible for reversible processes)
- Fast rates
- Get as much as we can as quickly as we can

- SAFETY AND PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS

To get a high Rate: 
- High temperature
- High pressure (gas, for a higher rate of reaction)
- Catalyst (not consumed)

To get a high Yield
- Le Chatelier's Principle
	- E.g. exothermic reactions favoured by low temperature

**Contact process and Haber process explicit in objective**
**Probably won't be asked for a blueprint of the factory**
**BUT - Remember key details**
- **E.g. Temp, pressure, catalyst**

## Haber Process


$$N_{2}+3H_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3} + \text{heat},\ \Delta \text{H= -92 kJ}$$

High rate requires:
- High pressure
- High temperature

High Yield requires
- high pressure
- Low temperature

**Conditions**
- High pressure (100 - 250 atm)
	- Not to high
		- safety
		- Expensive
- **Compromise**: Medium temperature (350˚C - 550˚C)
	- Reasonable rate AND yield
	- If it is too low, the rate is slow, but the yield is high

$NH_{3}$ is removed as reaction proceeds
$N_{2} \text{ and } H_{2}$ is added
Doesn't reach equilibrium, but the yield argument still applies


## Contact Process
- Manufacture of sulfuric acid
- Get $SO_{2}$
	- This is a by-product - greenhouse gas + acidic, from many industrial processes
- This process used to capture $SO_{2}$ and fix in solution

$$2SO_{2}+O_{2} \rightleftharpoons 2SO_{3} + \text{heat}$$

Factors increasing rate:
- High temperature
- High pressure
- Catalyst

Increase yield
- Favoured by lower temperature
- Favoured by high pressure

**Conditions**
- Compromise: Medium temperature (450˚C)
- Catalyst $V_{2}O_{5}$
- Pressure: 1-2 atmospheres
- ECONOMIC COMPROMISE
	- Benefits of higher pressures are outweighed by associated costs
