### Hydrocarbons
- Only hydrogen and carbon
- Aliphatic: Straight chains
- Alicyclic: rings
- Aromatic: Benzene
- Combustion $\to CO_{2} + H_{2}O$
- Alkanes: single bonded Carbon atoms
	- Saturated
Naming is based on longest chain
1. Meth
2. Eth
3. Prop
4. But
5. Pent
6. Hex
7. Hept
8. Oct

**in an exam you must draw H's**

IUPAC: only number stuff if you need to
Structural Isomers: different arrangements, same formula

### Halogen Substitution
- Basically a halogen just replaces an H atom

### Alkanes
- Insoluble in water

### Alkenes
- Double bonds between carbon atoms - unsaturated
- add a prefix to the number of double bonds
- Shake with aqueous bromine (bromine water), it will rapidly decolourise

### Benzene
- Aromatic hydrocarbon
- $C_{6}H_{6}$
- Strangely stable
- Thought to be alternating single and double bonds
	- But Double bonds are stronger than single bonds
- It kinda looks like a nut
	- Like, the one on a screw
- Delocalised electrons within molecule
	- thus cannot conduct electricity
- The electrons move around in the molecule, contributing to its stability

### Carboxylic acids
- Products of oxidation of alcohols
- Organic acids
- Functional group is $OOH^-$, attached to end carbon
	- Double bond between Carbon and Oxygen group
	- E.g. ethanoic acid
- -anoic acid suffix
- Default start of chain is the acid functional group

### Aldehyde
- Double bonded oxygen on the end of a chain
- Functional group of $OH^-$
- Slightly polar
- Medium m.p. - b.p.??
- not particularly solube
- Hydrogen bonding with water
- -al suffix

### Ketones
- Similar to aldehydes
- But double bonded oxygen is in middle of chain
	- Put number between -one and prefix
- Excellent solvent for stuff other than water
- -one suffix (pronounced like own)


### Alcohols
- $OH^-$ functional group somewhere on the chain
- -ol suffix
- Hydrogen bonding between molecules
	- Relatively high m.p. and b.p.
	- Soluble in water
		- Separate by distillation
- Oxidation (not combustion)
- Primary: carbon bonded to functional group is bonded to only 1 other carbon atom
- Secondary: carbon bonded to functional group is bonded to only 2 other carbon atoms
- Tertiary: carbon bonded to functional group is bonded to only 3 other carbon atoms
- tertiary do not oxidise YAY!
- form esters (later) (polyesters)
	- Alcohol and acid organically joining together with oxygen
- Reacts with sodium
	- $2CH_{3}CH_{4}O + 2Na \to H_{2(g)}+2Na^+[CH_{3}CH_{4}O]^-$
	- -oxide suffix
	- in this case, eth-oxide
	- Primary > secondary > tertiary in terms of reactivity with sodium
- Hydration creates alcahols
- Fermentation: yeast respire without $O_{2}$ to give alcohol and $CO_{2}$
	- 13% $\to$ distillation

### Esters
- Acid + alcohol creates an ester and water
- Double bonded oxygen on carbon atom
- Can't form hydrogen bonds with itself
	- lower mp/bp than alcohol/acid
	- Can form hydrogen bonds with water
- Warm ester reacts with sulphuric acid, it reforms an acid and alcohol
- Warm ester and $OH^-$ gives alcohol back and acid salt ion

### Amides
- Functional group is $NH_{2}$
- Primary - not the same as alcohols
- Hydrogen bonding 
	- Nitrogen has less electrons, thus weaker IMFs than alcohols

### Moles and Pressure, volume and temperature
- Pressure is proportional to temperature (gas) and number of moles of gas
- It is inversely proportional to volume
- $PV = nRT$
