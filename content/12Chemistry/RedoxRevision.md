### Oxidation
- Oxidation - Gain of oxygen, loss of hydrogen were original observations
- **OIL: Oxidation Is Loss of electrons**
- Gain in oxidation number

### Reduction
- Loss of oxygen, gain of hydrogen were original observations
- **RIG: Reduction Is Gain of electrons**
- Reduction in oxidation number

### Redox
- Redox Reaction: reaction where a species is oxidised, and a species is reduced
- Examples
	- Acid metal (metal displaced hydrogen)
	- Combustion
	- Metal displacement
	- Halogen Displacement
- Oxidising agent/Oxidant
	- Causes something to be oxidised
	- Thus is reduced
- Reducing agent/Reductant
	- Causes something to be reduced
	- Thus is oxidised

Additionally, if the E˚Cell is positive, the reaction is spontaneous


## Galvanic cells
- Anode is negative
	- Site of oxidation
- Cathode is positive
	- Site of reduction
- Salt bridge: completes circuit and prevents buildup of charge

### Corrosion
- Metals can react with $O_{2}$
- Read up on: **Rusting of iron**
- Prevention
	- Scal
	- Alloy
	- Galvinisation
	- Sacrificial anode
