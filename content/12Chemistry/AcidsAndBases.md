### Arrhenius Theory - Year 11 Stuff, not applicable in Year 12
- Acids are substances that ionise into $H^+$ ions
-  Bases are substances that disassociate into $OH^-$ ions
- Electrolytes: substances that ionise/disassociate in an aqueous solution
	- Strong electrolytes completely ionise/disassociate
	- Weak electrolytes only partially ionise
- Pros:
	- Nice and easy
- Doesn't cover anything

### Brønsted-Lowry
- Acid is a proton donor ($H^+$ is a proton)
- Base is a proton acceptor
- Conjugate Acid-Base pair: A pair of substances that differ by an $H^+$ ion
	- When $H^+$ is accepted/donated, it turns into the other substance
- Amphoteric: A substance that can act as both an acid and a base
	- "Self ionisation" of water
- Mono-protic Acid: it can only donate one proton
- Poly-protic: it can donate more than one proton

#### Acid Strength
- Ability to donate a proton
- Often measured through $K_{a}$ value
- This is the K value for equilibrium in an aqueous solution

$$\frac{[CH_{3}COO^-][H_{3}O^+]}{[]CH_{3}COOH]}, \text{ K}_{a} = 1.76 * 10^-5, \text{ at 25˚C}$$

- If $K_{a}$ is greater than 1, it is a strong acid
- **The stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base**
- Often shown in table
	- Strong acid is top left
	- Strong base is bottom right
	- IT'S LIKE THE SRP TABLE VALUES
		- well, not really
		- but kinda same structure????
	- Oxide ion is stronger base than $OH^-$
	- Thus it doesn't exist in a solution
- Larger $K_{a} \to$ more ionisation $\to$ stronger acid

- Strength  of acid/base
	- Strong
		- Fully ionised/disassociated
	- Weak
		- Partially
	- Stronger - more ionisation
- Concentration: mol/L of substance
- If an acid/base is strong, concentration does not matter, it is still strong

## Hydrolysis
- Gives pH of a solution
- Brønsted-Lowry with $H_{2}O$ molecule
- basically asking if $H_{2}O$ will act as a base or an acid

##### pH of ionic solutions
- Will the ion act as a base/acid when dissolved
- Which is it more likely to do
- Neutral: $SO_{4}^{2-}$, $NO_{3}^-$, Group I and II metals
	- Tail of a strong acid forms a neutral solution
	- Lucarelli says sulfate is basic but Pearson says it's neutral
- Some metals (transition) such as $Al^{3+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$ are acidic
	- They form hydrated complex ions and undergo hydrolysis 
	- Best described as Lewis Acids
		- Not in syllabus

## pH
- Logarithmic scale quantifying the concentration of hydrogen ions

$$\text{pH} = - \log_{10}[H^+]= -\log_{10}[H_{3}O^+]$$


$$[H^+] = 10^{- \text{pH}}$$

$$\text{At 25˚ C: }K_{w} = 10^{-14} = [H^+][OH^-]$$
- If a solution is neutral $[H^+]=[OH^-]$
- More of both as equilibrium shifts right with temperature
- pH of 7 is neutral at 25˚ C

## Buffers
- Restrict changes to pH 
	- When small amounts of an acid/base are added
- Solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base
	- E.g. acetic (ethanoic) acid **mixed with** acetate (ethanoate) solution
$$CH_{3}COOH_{(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^+_{(aq)} + CH_{3}COO^- _{(aq)}$$

- **Buffer capacity: ability to resist pH changes**
	- Relative concentrations: equimolar concentrations of acid and conjugate base is best
	- High concentrations: enable more $H_{3}O^+$ or $OH^-$ to be absorbed/neutralised]
- Add 1 mole of strong base for every 2 moles of weak acid
	- 1 mole of weak acid is neutralised
	- Thus, there is 1 mole of conjugate base for every mole of weak acid

##### Acidic Buffer solution pH < 7
$$CH_{3}COOH_{(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^+_{(aq)} + CH_{3}COO^- _{(aq)}$$

**Add $H_{3}O^+$???**
- By LCP, reverse reaction is favoured, $H_{3}O^+$ (not all of it - partial) is consumed, equilibrium shifts left
- Net: $[H_{3}O^+]$ partially increases
- pH remains constant(ish) (slightly lower)
**Add $OH^-$???**
- $[H_{3}O^+]$ decreases, thus by LCP, forward reaction is favoured, produces more $H_{3}O^+$ , equilibrium shifts right
- Net: $[H_{3}O]$ partially decreases
- pH remains constant (slightly higher - PARTIAL increase)

$$OH^- + CH_{3}COOH \to H_{2}O + CH_{3}COOH$$
- Direct reaction with molecule can occur

##### Basic Buffer solution pH > 7
$$NH_{3} + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons NH_{4}^+ + OH^-$$

Add $H_3 O^+$
- $[OH^-]$ decreases, thus by LCP, forward reaction is favoured, produces more $OH^-$, equilibrium shifts right
- Net: $[OH^-]$ partially decreases
- pH remains reasonably constant (slightly lower)

**Add $OH^-$???**
- By LCP, reverse reaction is favoured, $OH^-$ (not all of it - partial) is consumed, equilibrium shifts left
- Net: $[OH^-]$ partially increases
- pH remains constant(ish) (slightly higher)

### Systems
- Biological: blood
	- $H_{2}CO_{3} / HCO_{3}^-$
	- $H_{2}PO_{4}^-/HPO_{4}^{2-}$
	- keeps pH constant
- Ocean Acidification
	- $CO_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons CO_{2(aq)}$
	- $CO_{2(aq)}+H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons H_{2}CO_{3(aq)}$
	- $H_{2}CO_{3(aq)}+H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^+_{(aq)} + HCO_{3(aq)}^-$
	- $HCO_{3(aq)}^- + H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^+_{(aq)} + CO_{3(aq)}^{2-}$


## Titrations

### Indicators
- Equilibrium influenced by $[H^+]$ ($[H_{3}O^+]$)

$$In^- +H_{3}O^+ \rightleftharpoons HIn + H_{2}O$$

- $In$ is the conjugate base of an indicator (A particular colour, e.g. colourless)
- $HIn$ is the conjugate acid of an indicator (A distinct colour from its conjugate base, e.g. tartar)
- Increases $[H_{3}O^+]$ (more acidic/lower pH)
- Favours forward reaction, Equilibrium shifts right
- Indicator is tartar at low pH
- Colourless at high pH

### Volumetric Analysis
- Volumetric - solution concentrations - titrations (acid - base)
- Make up a solution of known concentration (Primary Standard)
	- Weigh solid
	- Known mass = known moles
	- Wash beaker with distilled water
	- Mix solid with distilled water (dissolve)
	- Transfer to volumetric flask
	- Measure the volume from **the bottom** of the meniscus
	- Transfer to storage bottle
		- Clean and dry
			- If not, rinse out thoroughly
			- Pour some of the solution in, swirl, and tip out if there is water left
		- School setting: must not be waterx
- Primary standard
	- High purity
- Low affinity for water
	- Not hygroscopic
	- Not deliquescent
- Standardise $HCl$ using primary $Na_{2} CO_{3(aq)}$ by titration
	- Rinsing:
		- Conical flask: rinse with $H_{2}O$ (known number of moles)
			- If it is rinsed with $Na_{2}CO_{3}$, volume of added $HCl$ increases, as concentration would be too low
		- Burette: Final rinse with $HCl$ (known concentration)
		- Pipette: Final rinse with $Na_{2}CO_{3(aq)}$ (known concentration)
	- Strong acid weak base titration, at equivalence point, solution is acidic
		- pH is below 7
	- Thus, an indicator with an equivalence point below 7 is used
- end point
	- You stop titrating; first permanent colour change of indicatorD

### Indicator Choice
- When a weak acid and strong base are titrated, the resulting salt will be basic
	- Thus, an indicator with an equivalence point above 7 is used
- When a strong acid and weak base are titrated, the resulting salt will be acidic
	- Thus, an indicator with an equivalence point below 7 is used
- When a strong acid and strong base are titrated, the resulting salt is neutral
	- Thus, an indicator with an equivalence point of 7, or **very close to** 7, is used
- When a weak acid and weak base are titrated, it is not favourable, as there must be large amounts of both present for a neutralisation to occur

### Calculations
- Titration situation is a common context for problems
- Tracking solutions/dilutions/samples

### Uncertainty
- Error for burette is ±0.05 mL
- Burette reading
	- If read from the top of the meniscus, it doesn't actually cause any significant error
	- This is because the difference is still the same, as the reading is taken significantly, and thus the amount of titrate added is the same
- Pippetting
	- Technique
	- Random error
- End point
	- Systematic uncertainty (always over)
	- Impacts accuracy
- Indicator Choice
	- Systematic
	- (wrong choice - technique)
- Incorrect rinsing, parallax
	- Dirty glasswear
	- Bad technique
	- CAN BE AVOIDEDs
