- -   Energy: Ability to do work
    -   Measured in Joules (J)
-   Work: $Fs$ = $Nm$

$$ E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

-   in Joules (J)

$$ E_p=mgh $$

-   in Joules (J)

$$ E_m=E_p+E_k $$

-   In this topic (Motion), we are mostly interest in ********************mechanical******************** energy, i.e. $E_p+E_k$
-   Energy is a conserved quantity
-   We will assume that total mechanical energy(TME) of an object in motion(includes at rest) is a constant

$$ Work=\Delta Energy=F\ s $$

-   Force in Newtons, Displacement in Meters
-   In order for work to be considered to have been done on an object by a force, then the displacement of the object has to be at least, in part, in the direction of the applied force
-   If the motion is perpendicular to the applied force and remains so, no work is done
