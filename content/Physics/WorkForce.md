- Energy: Ability to do work
    -   Measured in Joules (J)
-   Work: $Fs$ = $Nm$

$$ E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

-   in Joules (J)

$$ E_p=mgh $$

-   in Joules (J)

$$ Work=\Delta Energy $$

$$ E_m=E_p+E_k $$

-   In this topic (Motion), we are mostly interest in ********************mechanical******************** energy, i.e. $E_p+E_k$
-   Energy is a conserved quantity
-   We will assume that total mechanical energy(TME) of an object in motion(includes at rest) is a constant
