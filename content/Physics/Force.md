## Force

Force: Mass (kg) x acceleration ($ms^{-2}$), units in Newtons (N)

-   Vector Quantity, include direction

$$ f=ma $$

-   We can use this for free body diagrams

-   If one arrow is bigger, it is accelerating in that direction
-   You can write the force as “$F_x$”, where x is the type, e.g. gravity
-   Thus, an object travelling at a constant velocity has no force, and all arrows are equal
    -   It has momentum
