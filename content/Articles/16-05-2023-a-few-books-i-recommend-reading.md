## The Inheritance Cycle, by Christopher Paolini

This is a book, reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but in my opinion, better. The author has composed their own language, and it's obvious that he has put a lot of thought into worldbuilding. This story is set in a dystopian fantasy, where an evil king rules over the land of Alagaesia. The Dragon Riders, the independent group that fought for peace, is now extinct. Enter, Eragon, a farm boy, who mysteriously gained a dragon egg, and is now destined to defeat the dark king.

I would highly recommend reading this. It's a complicated read, the writing syntax is much like Lord of the Rings. Possibly my favourite book series of all time. It has 4 books: Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance. There's also another side-story, called "The Fork, the Witch and the Worm". 

## To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, by Christopher Paolini

I really like this author. In this, he writes a science fiction book, set in the far future, where humanity has expanded beyond the solar system, across the galaxy. Kira Naver√©z comes into contact with an extraterrestrial organism which bonds to her, and finds herself in the midst of an intergalactic war for possession of the alien.

Again, his writing syntax is very mature, and it's a brilliant book. However, his books are quite long, but his worldbuilding is insane.
