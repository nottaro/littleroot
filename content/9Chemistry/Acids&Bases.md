## Acids
- Substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) into an aqueous solution (containing water)  
### Properties of Acids
- Corrosive
- Sour taste
- Turn blue litmus paper red
- React with some metals releasing hydrogen gas and leaving a salt behind
- Conduct electricity
- Neutralised by bases causing water and a salt

### Strength of Acids
- Not pure substances
- Mixtures of acid with water
	- Why we commonly refer to a "concentration" of acid
	- How many acid molecules are there?
- When mixed with water some of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule are released to form hydrogen ions
- Strong acids release more hydrogen ions
- Strength means how many hydrogen ions are released?
- 3 common strong acids
	- Hydrochloric acid
	- Sulfuric Acid
	- Nitric Acid
- Acid is considered to be weak if the molecules only release a small amount of hydrogen ions
- Number of hydrogen atoms within a solution depends on
	- Strength of the acid
	- Concentration of the acid

> [!info] IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!!!
> - Strength of acid and the concentration if an acid are not the same thing
> - Strong acid = completely ionise in water
> - Weak acid = do not completely ionise in water
> - Concentrated acid = more particles present in water
> 	- Not necessarily ions
> - Dilute acid = less particles present in the water

## Bases and alkalis
- Base is a substance that releases Hydroxide ions
- If a base can be dissolved in water, it is known as an alkali
- The solution it forms is known as an alkaline solution
- WE can have strong bases and weak bases
	- Depends on release of hydroxide ions
- Can burn you as bad as acids

### Properties of bases and alkalis
- Caustic
	- Able to burn or corrode organic tissue by chemical action
- Soapy and slimy
- Turn red litmus paper blue
- Have bitter case (think coffee)
- Conduct electricity
- Neutralised by acids producing water and a salt
#### Common bases
- Sodium hydroxide
- Potassium Hydroxide
- Ammonium hydroxide
- Calcium hydroxide
- Magnesium hydroxide
- NOT ALL BASES ARE HYDROXIDES
- Sodium carbonate
- Potassium phosphate
- Ammonia

### Strong and weak bases
- Strong bases completely ionise in water
	- All of the molecules disassociate into positive ions and negative hydroxide ions
	- The less hydroxide ions produced by a base the weaker it is

## pH
- Concentration of hydrogen ions is measured using pH scale
- In an acidic solution, there are more hydrogen ions than hydroxide ions
- In an alkaline solution, there are more hydroxide ions than hydrogen ions

### Measuring pH
- Indicators are chemicals that change colour to show whether a substance is acidic, neutral or basic
- Common indicator is litmus paper
- Turns red when dipped in acid
- Turns blue when dipped in base
- Litmus does not tell us the exact pH but other indicators do

## Acid Reactions

Acid + Base → Salt + Water

Acid + Metal → Salt + H2

Acid + Metal Oxide → Salt + Water

Acid + Carbonate → Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide

### Neutralisation
- Acids release $H^+$
- Bases absorb $H^+$
- Resultant products are salts and water (H+ and OH- )
- Can also be written as metal hydroxide in some instances
- Acid + Base → Salt + Water

### Metals
- Metals and acid react to produce hydrogen gas($H^+$ ions bond)
- Other product is metal salt
- Acid + metal  → salt + hydrogen

### Metal oxides
- Similar to metal reactions
- Difference - oxygen from oxide bonds with $H^+$ ions
- Acid + Metal Oxide → Salt + Water

### Carbonates
- Carbonates also react with acids
- Acid + Carbonate → Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide
