- Types:
	- Synthesis (combination)
	- Decomposition
	- Single Displacement
	- Double displacement
	- Neutralisation (Acid/base)
	- Combustion

- Chemical change: any change in which a new substance is formed
	- Release of energy as heat/light
	- Change in colour
	- Odour



1. Neutralisation
	- Acid(H) + Base(OH) →  salt + H(OH)
2. Combustion  
    - AB + oxygen → CO2 + H2O
3. Synthesis
	- A + B → AB
4. Decomposition  
    - AB → A + B
5. Single Displacement
	- AB + C → AC + B
6. Double displacement
	- AB + CD → AC + BD

> [!info] IMPORTANT NOTE
> 
> Please don't use "Single displacement" or "Double Displacement" past year 9. In year 10, you'll learn a new set of reactions called "Redox Reactions"
