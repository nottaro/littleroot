### Homogenous mixtures
- 2 or more particles are mixed together so well that you only see one thing
- Composition is uniform throughout
- Composition is spread evenly

### Pure Substance
- Only one kind of particle in it

### Heterogenous materials
- Can see 2 or more parts
- Composition is not spread evenly

### Homogenous Materials
- Can see only one thing
- One set of properties

### Solute
- What is dissolved
- E.g. salt in salt water

### Solvent
- What dissolves the solute
- E.g. water in salt water

### Solutions
- Solute is equally distributed in solventÂ 
- Saturated solution
	- Concentration of solute is at a maximum
	- No more solute can dissolve
- Supersaturated Solution
	- At a high temperature, solution appears saturated
	- At lower temperatures, solute will precipitate out
- Unsaturated solution
	- Concentration of solute is below maximum
	- More solute can dissolve

### Cations and anions
- Form when ionic bonds are broken
- Cation
	- Positive ion
- Anion
	- Negative ion

### Solubility of Salts in Water
- Soluble
	- Most nitrate ($NO_3 ^-$) salts
	- Most salts of $Na^+$, $K^+$, and $NH_4 ^+$
	- Most chloride salts
