### Atoms
- Smallest particle of matter
- Made up of subatomic particles
- Has a nucleus, containing protons and neutrons
- Has electrons in orbits around the nucleus
- Matter can’t be created or destroyed only changed

### Molecules
- Atoms can form chemical bonds(attracted and stuck to each other)
- 2 or more atoms chemically bounded is called a molecule
- Atoms of the same element can bond together
- Atoms of different elements can bond together

### Elements
- Made up of one type of atom
- All their atoms are the same
- Cannot be broken down into anything simpler
- 118 elements
- 94 are naturally occurring, others are artificial
- Found on periodic table
- Can be made up of molecules
- Has a chemical system

### Compound
- is made up of more than 1 element
- Described by a chemical formula
- States which atoms are in one unit of the compound
- Not all are made up of molecules, but many are.

### Mixtures
- Solute is a substance that is dissolved in a solution
- Pure substances
	- Elements and compound-Cant be split into anything simpler
	- Has a unique feature
	- Always have the same physical properties
	- Always have the same chemical properties

### Impure substances
- Mixtures
- Can be physically separated
- Properties are an average of the properties of the ingredients
- Physical properties depend on the proportion of each substance in the mixture
- Melting and boiling points and density depend on the ratio of the ingredients
- Chemical reactivity can vary, depending on mixture and particle size

### Homogeneous
- Particles are evenly distributed
- Aqueous solution is when there is a homogeneous liquid with something dissolved in it
- Can be mixture, element or compound
- Only one state of matter
- Are uniform and consistent throughout

### Heterogeneous
- Particles are not evenly distributed
- All must be a mixture
- Not uniform throughout
- Can see separate ingredients
- Can be in different states of matter

### Solution
- Form when one material dissolves in another
- Is homogenous
- Substance that dissolves is a solute
- Substance that dissolves the solute is a solvent
- Is transparent
- Solute is split up into tiny particles, evenly distributed through the solvent, which ae too small to see(even under a microscope)
- Not all substances dissolve well in a solvent.
- Substances that dissolve well are soluble
- Substances that don't dissolve well are insoluble
- Substances might be insoluble in water but soluble in a different solvent

### Suspension
- Formed when an insoluble solid mixes with a liquid and does not dissolve
- Are heterogenous
- Particles of the solid are quite large and visible
- Makes it opaque
- Particles of the solid will settle to the bottom over time
- Suspensions are separated by filtration

### Colloids
- Between solutions and suspensions
- Homogeneous
- Particles are not dissolved
- Particles are smaller than suspensions, so do not settle at all, but stay mixed
- Particles scatter light
- Opaque
- a homogeneous non-crystalline substance consisting of large molecules or ultramicroscopic particles of one substance dispersed through a second substance. Colloids include gels, sols, and emulsions; the particles do not settle, and cannot be separated out by ordinary filtering or centrifuging like those in a suspension.

### Emulsions
-  Fine dispersion of minute droplets of one liquid in another in which it is not soluble or miscible
- Opaque
- Heterogenous
- E.g. egg yolk, butter, oil and water

##### Miscible: Forms a homogeneous mixture when added together with another miscible

##### Matter: anything that has volume or weight

##### Weight: Gravity's pull on mass

##### Mass: Space occupied by object
