1920s
- decade where close reading/practical criticism/unseen text as assessment becomes part of the Cambridge curriculum
	- blame i.a. richards

**i.a. richards**
- Started experiments
- gave 4 poems to students
	- no names
	- no titles
	- no publication dates
- students did not identify them with very few exceptions
- he encouraged the students to go and read the poems any number of times
- had some weird instructions
	- Comment in any form that they desire
	- write down the number of times they read each of the 4 poems
	- hinted that the poems were a mixed bunch
		- some were good, some were not
- Students wrote short commentaries and submitted them to richards
	- half were female half were male
	- side not: his lectures were very popular
- he would give lectures not on the given poems, but on the responses of the students
- whole aim was the identify common interpreting errors in students' commentary
- he was v committed and understanding of the difficulty of reading a poem
- hardest thing of creating a poem was creating the sense of a poem????
- richards is lecturing to WW1 veterans
	- difficult for us to apprehend how big of a difference he made to those people who were experiencing ptsd after horrors of WW1
- richards had a vision of what poetry is and what it could do
- how did he get such good responses from his students waw
	- his biographer, "john paul" has some suggestions
		- point number 3 in given page
	- basically he was analysing poems in a close, systematic way
**the most basic thing that he was getting students to do was to make out the plain sense/meaning of the poem**
- this is the main thing that they want you to do
- move from literal to metaphorical
