## Business Trade Cycle (BTC)
- Describes fluctuations in the growth of real output, consisting of alternating periods of expansion (increasing real output) and contraction (decreasing real output)
- A business cycle plots **real GDP** on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis
- GDP here is measured in real terms, so that the vertical axis measures changes in the volume of output produced after the influence of price-level changes has been eliminated

## Phases of the BTC

### Expansion
- An expansion occurs when there is positive growth in real GDP, shown by these parts of the curve that slope upwards
- During periods of real GDP growth, **employment of resources increases**, and the **general price level** of the economy (which is an average over all prices) usually begins to rise more rapidly (this is known as **inflation**)

### Peak
- A peak represents the cycle's maximum real GDP, and marks the end of the expansion
- When the economy reaches a peak, unemployment of resources has fallen substantially, and the general price level may be rising quit rapidly. 
	- The economy is likely to be experiencing inflation

### Contraction
- Following the peak, the economy begins to experience falling real GDP (negative growth), shown by the downwards sloping parts of the curve
- **If the contraction lasts 6 months (2 quarters) or more, it is termed a recession, characterised by falling real GDP, and growing unemployment of resources**
- Increases in the price level may slow down a lot, and it is even possible that prices in some sectors may begin to fall
- Deflation: outright fall in prices
- Disinflation: rising general prices at a falling rate

### Trough
- A trough represents the cycle's minimum level of GDP, or the end of the contraction
- There may now be widespread unemployment
- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion (also known as a recovery), marking the beginning of a new cycle
