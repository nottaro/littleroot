[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)

- Market power is the ability of a business to insulate itself from competition
- It also refers to the ability of a firm (or group of firms) to raise and maintain price above the level that would prevail under competition; this is referred to as market or monopoly power
- The exercise of market power leads to reduced output and loss of economic welfare

### Competitive Market
- Competition is generally understood to be a process in which rivals compete in order to achieve some objective.
- Competition in microeconomics occurs when there are many buyers and sellers acting independently, so that no one has the ability to influence the price at which a product is sold in the market.
- This should be contrasted with market power, also known as monopoly power, which refers to the control that a seller may have over the price of the product it sells. 
- The greater the market power, the greater is the control over price. 
- On the other hand, the greater the degree of competition between sellers, the smaller their market power, and the weaker is their control over the price.

### Imperfect Markets
- A competitive market is characterised by a large number of small firms free entry and exit and very little product differentiation. 
- When one or more of these conditions is NOT MET - the market is said to be ‘imperfect’ 
- An imperfect market exists when: 
	1. There are relatively small number of firms 
	2. Firms have market power 
	3. Firms use product differentiation 
	4. Barriers to entry are used to restrict competition
