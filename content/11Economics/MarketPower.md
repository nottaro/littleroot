title: Market Power

[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)

- Market power is the ability of a business to insulate itself from competition
- It also refers to the ability of a firm (or group of firms) to raise and maintain price above the level that would prevail under competition; this is referred to as market or monopoly power
- The exercise of market power leads to reduced output and loss of economic welfare

## Competitive Market
- Competition is generally understood to be a process in which rivals compete in order to achieve some objective.
- Competition in microeconomics occurs when there are many buyers and sellers acting independently, so that no one has the ability to influence the price at which a product is sold in the market.
- This should be contrasted with market power, also known as monopoly power, which refers to the control that a seller may have over the price of the product it sells. 
- The greater the market power, the greater is the control over price. 
- On the other hand, the greater the degree of competition between sellers, the smaller their market power, and the weaker is their control over the price.

## Imperfect Markets
- A competitive market is characterised by a large number of small firms free entry and exit and very little product differentiation. 
- When one or more of these conditions is NOT MET - the market is said to be ‘imperfect’ 
- An imperfect market exists when: 
	1. There are relatively small number of firms 
	2. Firms have market power 
	3. Firms use product differentiation 
	4. Barriers to entry are used to restrict competition
- The best examples of imperfect competition are monopoly and oligopoly markets. 
- A monopoly is a market with just one firm
	- Synergy and Australia Post are government regulated monopolies.
- An oligopoly is a market with a few large dominant firms
	- Coles and Woolworths dominate the grocery market in Australia

### Monopoly
- Monopoly is a type of market structure where there is 
	- A single firm dominating the market for a product, and
	- Where high barriers to entry (factors making it difficult for other firms to enter the industry) ensure that the monopoly position of the single seller can be preserved.
- Monopoly power, also known as market power, refers to the ability of a firm or a group of firms to control the price of the product they sell. 
- Monopoly power can be exercised not only by monopolies, but also by firms in oligopolies, where there are a few large sellers.
- Monopoly power is considered to be socially undesirable because it leads to:
	- A welfare loss, as social surplus is less than maximum
	- Allocative inefficiency - there is an underallocation of resources to the good 
	- Lower output and a higher price of the industry than the output and price of a more competitive market

### Imperfect Markets: Barriers to Entry
- Barriers to entry are an important feature of imperfect markets. • A barrier to entry is anything that restricts or blocks the entry of new firms into an industry or market. 
- They may include government regulation, patents, technology barriers, startup costs and licensing requirements.
- Examples of entry barriers:
	- Controlling a scarce resource – if a mining company secured the only diamond mine in the country, it would have sole rights to mine the gems. 
	- A government licence granting a legal monopoly e.g. Australia Post 
	- A technological advantage – e.g. Microsoft has considerable market power because it supplies the operating system used in most computers. 
	- A patent on an invention gives protection from competition (up to 17 years in Australia) eg pharmaceutical firms
	- Extensive product differentiation, brand proliferation, large advertising budget, controlling retail outlets. 
	- Economies of scale – only a few firms can compete in the market because of the large set up costs 
		- Economies of scale: Cost advantages companies experience when production becomes efficient, as costs can be spread over a larger amount of goods.
	- Collusive behaviour – when firms agree to share markets, to fix prices or quantities or to otherwise seek to reduce competition and / or prevent new firms entering the market
