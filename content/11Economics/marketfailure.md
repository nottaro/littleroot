title: Market Failure
enableToc: true
---

- We learned that in a free competitive market, when the price of a good adjusts to make quantity demanded equal to quantity supplied, the equilibrium quantity reflects the 'best' or optimal allocation of resources to the production of that good
- This condition is known as allocative efficiency, achieved when marginal benefit equals marginal cost (MB=MC), or when social surplus is maximum

- Market failure refers to the failure of the market to allocate resources efficiently
- Market failure results in allocative inefficiency, where too much or too little of goods or services are produced and consumed from the point of view of what is socially most desirable
- Over-provision (over-provided) of a good means too many/much resources are allocated to its production (over-allocation)
- Under-provision means that too few resources are allocated to its production (under-allocation)

## Market Failure: 3 Main Sources
1. Public Goods and Common Resources
2. Externalities
3. Market Power

### Public Goods and Common Resources
What is a Public Good?
- A useful way to classify different goods in the economy is to use 2 criteria (from a viewpoint of allocative efficiency):
	1. Rivalry(rival in consumption)
		- Does consumption by one person reduce supply available to other users?
		- Increase in consumption by one consumer leads to a fall in total supply of the good
	1. Excludability
		- Whether a good is excludable - is it possible to exclude a non-payer from consuming to good to service?
		- Exclusion of consumers is made possible, or is not costly

### Private Goods
- Rivalrous in consumption
- Excludable in consumption

### Public Goods
- Goods that are non-rival and non-excludable are also known as pure public goods
- Non-rival in consumption
- Non-excludable in consumption
	- Free rider problem
- No demand (price signals)
- No supply
- Hence no market arises (via price mechanism)
- Provide significant social benefits
- E.g., lighthouse
- Socially desirable

### Public Goods and the Free Rider Problem

**Excludable Goods**
- It is possible to prevent people from buying and using a good simply by charging a price for it; those who do not pay the price do not buy it and do not get to use it
- Therefore., private firms have an incentive to provide excludable goods because they can charge a price for them, and therefore can cover their costs
**Non-Excludable Goods**
- If a non-excludable good were to be produced by a private firm, people could not be prevented from using it even though it was produced by private firms
**The Free Rider Problem**
- Arises from non-excludability, people cannot be excluded from using the good
- Public goods are a type of market failure, because due to the free rider problem, private firms do not produce these goods
