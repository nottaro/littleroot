[go back](Subjects/Economics.md)

- We learned that in a free competitive market, when the price of a good adjusts to make quantity demanded equal to quantity supplied, the equilibrium quantity reflects the 'best' or optimal allocation of resources to the production of that good
- This condition is known as allocative efficiency, achieved when marginal benefit equals marginal cost (MB=MC), or when social surplus is maximum

- Market failure refers to the failure of the market to allocate resources efficiently
- Market failure results in allocative inefficiency, where too much or too little of goods or services are produced and consumed from the point of view of what is socially most desirable
- Over-provision (over-provided) of a good means too many/much resources are allocated to its production (over-allocation)
- Under-provision means that too few resources are allocated to its production (under-allocation)

# Market Failure: 3 Main Sources
1. Public Goods and Common Resources
2. Externalities
3. Market Power

## Public Goods and Common Resources
What is a Public Good?
- A useful way to classify different goods in the economy is to use 2 criteria (from a viewpoint of allocative efficiency):
	1. Rivalry(rival in consumption)
		- Does consumption by one person reduce supply available to other users?
		- Increase in consumption by one consumer leads to a fall in total supply of the good
	1. Excludability
		- Whether a good is excludable - is it possible to exclude a non-payer from consuming to good to service?
		- Exclusion of consumers is made possible, or is not costly

### Private Goods
- Rivalrous in consumption
	- Consumption by one person reduces its availability for someone else
- Excludable in consumption
	- It is possible to exclude people from using the good
	- Usually achieved by charging a price
	- People who refuse to or cannot pay the price are excluded
- Since most goods are rivalrous, and excludable, most goods are private goodds

### Public Goods
- Goods that are non-rival and non-excludable are also known as pure public goods
- Non-rival in consumption
- Non-excludable in consumption
	- Free rider problem
- No demand (price signals)
- No supply
- Hence no market arises (via price mechanism)
- Provide significant social benefits
- E.g., lighthouse
- Socially desirable

### Public Goods and the Free Rider Problem

**Excludable Goods**
- It is possible to prevent people from buying and using a good simply by charging a price for it; those who do not pay the price do not buy it and do not get to use it
- Therefore., private firms have an incentive to provide excludable goods because they can charge a price for them, and therefore can cover their costs
**Non-Excludable Goods**
- If a non-excludable good were to be produced by a private firm, people could not be prevented from using it even though they would not pay for it
- Yet no profit-maximising firm would be willing to produce a good it cannot sell at some price
- As a result, the market fails to produce goods that are non-excludable, giving rise to resource misallocation, as no resources are allocated to the production of public goods
**The Free Rider Problem**
- Arises from non-excludability, people cannot be excluded from using the good
- Public goods are a type of market failure, because due to the free rider problem, private firms do not produce these goods: the market fails to allocate resources to their production

### Common Access Resources
- A category of market failure is Common Access Resources (CARs)
- Not owned by any private individual or firm, so do not have a price, but are available for anyone to use without direct payment
- Hence, without government intervention, these resources are vulnerable to overuse and abuse
- E.g., fisheries, irrigations, rivers, forests, atmosphere
- Even for renewable resources, such as fish stocks, the overuse of these resources can lead to a long-term decline beyond the sustainable level in the stock of natural capital
- **Non-excludable**
	- As they are freely available, there tends to be over-consumption of such resources
	- Hence, common access resources are difficult to sustain, which is why governments intervene to prevent the depletion or destruction of such goods
- **Rivalrous**
	- Consumption of these resources diminishes the quantity and possibly quality of remaining resources for the current and future generations to use
	- In the case of over-consumption of CARs, sustainability becomes a real issue so generations to come may be deprived of any access to these resources
- **Tragedy of the commons**
	- CARs create a situation known as the "Tragedy of the Commons"
	- This means: Degradation, depletion or destruction of a CAR caused by the problems of overuse (or abuse) and over-consumption

## Externalities
- Occurs when the actions of consumers or producers give rise to *negative* or *positive* side effects on others who are **not part of these actions**,  and whose interests are not taken into consideration
- People (not involved in the economic transaction) feeling the effects of an externality are often referred to as "third parties"
- If these side-effects (spillovers) on third parties involve benefits, there arises a **positive externality**, also known as **external benefit**
- If they involve costs in the form of side-effects (spillovers), there arises a **negative externality**, also known as **external costs** 
- Externalities can arise from either **consumption activities** (consumption externalities) or **producer activities** (producer externalities)
- There are 4 types of externalities
	1. Negative Production Externalities
	2. Negative Consumption Externalities
	3. Positive Production Externalities
	4. Positive Consumption Externalities

### Negative Production Externalities
- Negative externalities of production refer to external costs created by producers
- The problem of environmental pollution, created as a side-effect of production activities, is very commonly analysed as a negative production externalities 

>[!example]- Cement factory
>
>Consider a cement factory that emits smoke into the air and disposes its waste by dumping it into the ocean. There is a production externality, because over and above the firm’s private costs of production, there are additional costs that spill over onto society due to the polluted air and ocean, with negative consequences for the local inhabitants, swimmers, sea life, the fishing industry and the marine ecosystem. This is shown in the Figure, where the supply curve, S = MPC, reflects the firm’s private costs of production, and the marginal social cost curve given by MSC represents the full cost to society of producing cement.![](11SubjectImages/negativeproductionexternality.png)
>
>For each level of output, Q, social costs of producing cement given by MSC are greater than the firm’s private costs. The vertical difference between MSC and MPC represents the external costs. Since the externality involves only production (the supply curve), the demand curve represents both marginal private benefits and marginal social benefits. The Figure illustrates a general point that you should keep in mind whenever you examine (or draw) an externality diagram: the free market outcome is determined by the intersection of MPB and MPC, resulting in quantity $Q_m$ and price $P_m$. The social optimum (or ‘best’) outcome is given by the intersection of MSB with MSC, which determines quantity $Q_{opt}$ and price $P_{opt}$.

> [!info]- Welfare Loss
> - Whenever there is an externality, there is a welfare (deadweight) loss, involving a reduction in social benefits, due to the misallocation of resources.
> - In the Figure, the shaded area represents the welfare loss arising from the negative production externality.
> - For all units of output greater than $Q_{opt}$, MSC > MSB, meaning that society would be better off if less were produced. ![](11SubjectImages/welfareloss.png)
> - The welfare loss is equal to the difference between MSC and MSB for the amount of output that is overproduced ($Q_m - Q_P{opt}$).
> - It is a loss of social benefits due to overproduction of the good caused by the externality
> - If the externality were corrected, so that the economy reaches the social optimum, the loss of benefits would disappear.
> - It may be useful to note that the point of the welfare loss triangle always lies at the $Q_{opt}$ quantity of output.
