## Negative Externalities of Production
### Government regulations
- Rely on "command" approach, using authority to enact legislation and regulations in the public's interest
- Regulations can be used to prevent or reduce the effects of production externalities
- In the case of the polluting firm, regulations can forbid the dumping of certain toxic substances into the environment
- More commonly, regulations do not totally ban the production of pollutants, but rather attempt to achieve one of the following
	1. Limit the emission of pollutants by setting a maximum limit of pollutants permitted
	2. Limit the quantity of output produced by the producer
	3. Require polluting firms to install technologies reducing the emissions
- The impact is to lower the quantity of the good produced and bring it to the optimal supply curve by shifting MPC up to MSC
- Pollutant and output restrictions achieve this by forcing the firm to produce less.
    
- Requirements to install technologies reducing emissions achieve this by imposing higher costs of production due to the purchase of the non-polluting technologies.
