title: Market Failure - Externalities
enableToc: true
---
- Occurs when the actions of consumers or producers give rise to *negative* or *positive* side effects on others who are **not part of these actions**,  and whose interests are not taken into consideration
- People (not involved in the economic transaction) feeling the effects of an externality are often referred to as "third parties"
- If these side-effects (spillovers) on third parties involve benefits, there arises a **positive externality**, also known as **external benefit**
- If they involve costs in the form of side-effects (spillovers), there arises a **negative externality**, also known as **external costs** 
- Externalities can arise from either **consumption activities** (consumption externalities) or **producer activities** (producer externalities)
- There are 4 types of externalities
	1. Negative Production Externalities
	2. Negative Consumption Externalities
	3. Positive Production Externalities
	4. Positive Consumption Externalities

### Negative Production Externalities
- Negative externalities of production refer to external costs created by producers
- The problem of environmental pollution, created as a side-effect of production activities, is very commonly analysed as a negative production externalities 

>[!example]- Cement factory
>
>Consider a cement factory that emits smoke into the air and disposes its waste by dumping it into the ocean. There is a production externality, because over and above the firm’s private costs of production, there are additional costs that spill over onto society due to the polluted air and ocean, with negative consequences for the local inhabitants, swimmers, sea life, the fishing industry and the marine ecosystem. This is shown in the Figure, where the supply curve, S = MPC, reflects the firm’s private costs of production, and the marginal social cost curve given by MSC represents the full cost to society of producing cement.![](11SubjectImages/negativeproductionexternality.png)
>
>For each level of output, Q, social costs of producing cement given by MSC are greater than the firm’s private costs. The vertical difference between MSC and MPC represents the external costs. Since the externality involves only production (the supply curve), the demand curve represents both marginal private benefits and marginal social benefits. The Figure illustrates a general point that you should keep in mind whenever you examine (or draw) an externality diagram: the free market outcome is determined by the intersection of MPB and MPC, resulting in quantity $Q_m$ and price $P_m$. The social optimum (or ‘best’) outcome is given by the intersection of MSB with MSC, which determines quantity $Q_{opt}$ and price $P_{opt}$.

> [!info]- Welfare Loss
> - Whenever there is an externality, there is a welfare (deadweight) loss, involving a reduction in social benefits, due to the misallocation of resources.
> - In the Figure, the shaded area represents the welfare loss arising from the negative production externality.
> - For all units of output greater than $Q_{opt}$, MSC > MSB, meaning that society would be better off if less were produced. ![](11SubjectImages/welfareloss.png)
> - The welfare loss is equal to the difference between MSC and MSB for the amount of output that is overproduced ($Q_m - Q_{opt}$).
> - It is a loss of social benefits due to overproduction of the good caused by the externality
> - If the externality were corrected, so that the economy reaches the social optimum, the loss of benefits would disappear.
> - It may be useful to note that the point of the welfare loss triangle always lies at the $Q_{opt}$ quantity of output.


### Negative Consumption Externalities
- Negative externalities of consumption refer to external costs created by consumers
- For example, when consumers smoke in public places, there are external costs that spill over onto society in the form of costs to non-smokers due to passive smoking
- Furthermore, smoking-related diseases result in higher-than-necessary health care costs that are an additional burden upon society
- When there is a consumption externality, the marginal private benefit (demand) curve does not reflect social benefits

### Positive Production Externalities
- Positive externalities of production refer to external benefits created by producers
- If, for example, a firm engages in research and development, and succeeds in developing a new technology that spreads throughout the economy, there are external benefits because not only the firm, but also society, benefits from widespread adoption of the new technology
- Therefore, the social costs of research and development are lower than the private costs.

### Positive Consumption Externalities
- When there is a positive externality of consumption
