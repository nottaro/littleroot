title: Superposition
---

- Superposition occurs when 2 waves travelling in the same medium meet
- Their amplitudes combine algebraically to produce a resultant wave **at that particular instant**
- When the 2 waves superimpose, the resultant displacement of the particles is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual displacements of the original waves

## Constructive Interference
- 2 waves of equal frequency that are **in phase** interfere/superimpose
- Resultant wave has an amplitude greater than each of the individual waves
- Equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves

## Destructive Interference
- 2 waves of equal frequency that are **not in phase** meet and superimpose, crating a resultant wave that has amplitude lower than each of the individual waves
- Here the individual waves have positive and negative amplitudes, and so they combine to produce a wave of smaller amplitude
- **Complete Destructive Interference**
