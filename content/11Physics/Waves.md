title: Waves
enableToc: true

- Waves: The transfer of energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter
	- I.e. after energy is transferred, there is no displacement of matter
- Mechanical waves: transfer energy from one place to another without the net place of another, but requires a medium to propogate
	- The particles in the medium vibrate back and forth about fixed positions (equilibriium position)
- Transverse waves: particles vibrate perpendicular to the direction od energy flow, e.g. water, electromagnetic waves
- Longitudinal waves: particles vibrate along straight lines parallel to the direciton of the energy flow

- However:
	1. Assumes no other disturrbances in the motion
	2. Ignores situations where there is no medium
- Requirements for medium:
	1. Mechanical waves must have a medium, e.g. sound
	2. Non-mechanical waves do not require a medium, e.g. EMR

## Anatomy of a Wave

- Crest: Highest displacement of a particle in the positive direction
	- Highest point in the graph
- Trough: Lowest displacement of a particle in the negative direction
	- Lowest point in the graph
- Wavelength ($\lambda$): Distance between any 2 consecutive points in a wave that are in phase
	- From one crest to another crest
	- From one trough to another trough
	- Distance it takes for the wave to repeat
- Frequency (f): The number of complete oscillations persecond. Unit of frequency is the Hz(Hertz)
- Period (T): Time take for one wavelength to complete (seconds)
- Phase: State of vibration that a particle has reached in its cycle of motion. Waves are in phase when particles of the wave move in the exact same way at the same time
- Speed = distance/time
- Distance = speed $\times$ time
$$v=f{\lambda}=\frac{\lambda}{T}$$

### Law of Reflection
- The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence
- Angle of incidence: angle between the incident ray and the normal
