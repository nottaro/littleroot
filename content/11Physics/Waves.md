- Waves: The transfer of energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter
	- I.e. after energy is transferred, there is no displacement of matter
- Mechanical waves: transfer energy from one place to another without the net place of another, but requires a medium to propogate
	- The particles in the medium vibrate back and forth about fixed positions (equilibriium position)
- Transverse waves: particles vibrate perpendicular to the direction od energy flow, e.g. water, electromagnetic waves
- Longitudinal waves: particles vibrate along straight lines parallel to the direciton of the energy flow
	- Compression is the point towards which surrounding particles move. Here the pressure is highest and pressure variance is the greatest + 
		- At the point where this occurs, particles are moving towards this point, i.e. converging
		- Force by the particles at that region per unit squared of area (pressure) is higher and so a compression is a sight of maximum pressure
	- A rarefraction is a point away from which surrounding particles move. Here the pressure is lopwwest and the pressure variance is the greatest - 
		- At the point where this occurs, particles are moving away from this point, i.e. diverging
		- Force by the particles at that region per unit squared (pressure) is 0 as there are no particles remaining at that distance

- However:
	1. Assumes no other disturrbances in the motion
	2. Ignores situations where there is no medium
- Requirements for medium:
	1. Mechanical waves must have a medium, e.g. sound
	2. Non-mechanical waves do not require a medium, e.g. EMR

### Displacement vs Distance
- At the site of the compressoion, the center particle is not moving at all, and thus displacement is 0
- However, all nearby particles are converging onto that positioon and so their displacement is +/-. 
- However, the displacement increases until the point of refraction, as the **further away** the particles are, **the further they move**

## Anatomy of a Wave
![](Images/236375072-3709402252.png)
- Crest: Highest displacement of a particle in the positive direction
	- Highest point in the graph
- Trough: Lowest displacement of a particle in the negative direction
	- Lowest point in the graph
- Wavelength ($\lambda$): Distance between any 2 consecutive points in a wave that are in phase
	- From one crest to another crest
	- From one trough to another trough
	- Distance it takes for the wave to repeat
- Frequency (f): The number of complete oscillations persecond. Unit of frequency is the Hz(Hertz)
- Period (T): Time take for one wavelength to complete (seconds)
- Phase: State of vibration that a particle has reached in its cycle of motion. Waves are in phase when particles of the wave move in the exact same way at the same time
- Speed = distance/time
- Distance = speed $\times$ time
- $v=f{\lambda}=\frac{\lambda}{T}$

## Speed of Sound
- These are the main factors affecting the speed of sound in any case;
	- Elasticity
		- Ability of a body to resist a distorting influence or deforming force and to return to its original size and shape when that influence 



### Law of Reflection
- The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence
- Angle of incidence: angle between the incident ray and the normal
