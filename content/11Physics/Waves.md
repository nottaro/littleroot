title: Waves
enableToc: true
---

- Waves: The transfer of energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter
	- I.e. after energy is transferred, there is no displacement of matter
- However:
	1. Assumes no other disturrbances in the motion
	2. Ignores situations where there is no medium
- Requirements for medium:
	1. Mechanical waves must have a medium, e.g. sound
	2. Non-mechanical waves do not require a medium, e.g. EMR
- Direction of Displacement of Particles in medium
	1. Transverse: perpendicular to medium
	2. Longitudinal: parallel to medium


### Law of Reflection
- The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence
- Angle of incidence: angle between the incident ray and the normal
