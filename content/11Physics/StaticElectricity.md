- 2 types of charge: positive and negative
- 3 types of charge state
	- Positive 
	- positron, proton, alpha particle, cation
	- Negative
		- electron, anion
	- Neutral
		- Neutron, anti-neutrino

- An object of charge will produce an electric field around it
- An electric field is the region around an object possessing the property of charge, which extends to infinity, and within which another object of charge (or not neutral object possessing charge) will experience an attractive or repulsive force, the strength of which decreases with distance, as per the inverse square law

## Electric Fields

### Field line rules
1. They're arrows, not lines (naming moment)
2. For point charges, field density is uniform, thus lines must be evenly distributed around surface
3. Field lines star/end at the surface
4. Field lines should start/finish perpendicular to surface
5. Number of field lines indicates field density
6. Minimum of 4 lines recommended (not **required**)
7. Direction of field lines are determined by hypothetical test charge
8. Field lines cannot touch or cross (segregation L)

## Charge
- Electrical charge can be transferred (the physical transfer of charge)
- Usually by physical transfer of electrons
	- Comes about as the result of friction
- Referred to as charging by conduction
- This is due to different substances having different electron affinity 
	- Triboelectric series shows the continuum of electron affinities of different substances
### Charging by Induction
- Occurs when $e^-$ are unevenly distributed throughout the structure of an electrically neutral species
