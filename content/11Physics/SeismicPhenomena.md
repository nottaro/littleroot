- Wave that travels through the Earth or a planetary body
- The propagation velocity of a seismic wave depends on density and elasticity of the medium as well as the type of wave. 
	- Velocity tends to increase with depth through Earth's crust and mantle, but drops sharply going from the mantle to Earth's outer core
- Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth.
-   Surface waves travel across the surface. Surface waves decay more slowly with distance than body waves which travel in three dimensions.
-   Particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so surface waves tend to cause more damage.
- Different travel times of seismic waves are used to locate their epicenter
- Refraction or reflection of seismic waves is used for research into Earth's internal structure
- Scientists sometimes generate and measure vibrations to investigate shallow, subsurface structures.
