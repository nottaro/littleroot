- Isotopes: Variety of a chemical element that has differing numbers of neutrons, and a different mass number
- All elements up to lead, have at least 1 non-radioactive isotope, except for Te and Pm
- All elements after uranium are not known in nature

## Nuclear Decay
- Unstable nucleus emits radiation and is transformed into the nucleus of one or more other element

## Transmutations
- Change in chemical of an atom
- Completely random, spontaneous process


### Half Life
- The time it takes for $1/2$ of a sample of a given radionuclide to undergo decay
- Ways of measuring
	- Number of nuclides (nuclides/time)
	- Mass of radioisotopes

$$N_1=N_0 \times (\frac{1}{2})^x$$
- where x is the number of half lives it has undergone, and $N_1$ and $N_0$ are the final and original amounts of the substance, respectively
