[go back](11Subjects/11Physics)

- Consists of converting electrical potential energy into other useful types of energy
- 3 parts to a circuit (minimum)
	1. Source of potential emergy
		1. Battery
		2. Electrical cells
		3. Power points
	2. Wires
	3. Device/Component/Resistor

- Current: conventional current, i.e. flow of positive charge
- Electron current refers to flow of electrons

 - Ammeter: measures current (I), unit ampere (A)
 - Voltmeter: measures potential difference (pd)
	 - Voltage (V)
	 - e.m.f., electromotive force
	 - Measured in volts (V)
- Galvanometer: a very sensitive ammeter
