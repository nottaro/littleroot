[go back](11Subjects/11Physics)

- Consists of converting electrical potential energy into other useful types of energy
- 3 parts to a circuit (minimum)
	1. Source of potential emergy
		1. Battery
		2. Electrical cells
		3. Power points
	2. Wires
	3. Device/Component/Resistor

- Current: conventional current, i.e. flow of positive charge
- Electron current refers to flow of electrons

## Circuit Diagrams

 - Ammeter: measures current (I), unit ampere (A)
 - Voltmeter: measures potential difference (pd)
	 - Voltage (V)
	 - e.m.f., electromotive force
	 - Measured in volts (V)
- Galvanometer: a very sensitive ammeter

## Why do electrons move in a circuit?
- ELectrical potential energy: results from a separation of charge, i.e. potential difference i.e. voltage i.e. e.m.f.
- $$V=\frac{W}{q}$$
- V = voltage/pd/emf measured in volts (V)
- W = ($\Delta E$) = work done on charges (J)
- q = charge (C)

### Current
- Current: rate of flow of charge
$$I=\frac{q}{\Delta t}$$
- I = current in amperes (A)
- q = charge (C)
- t = time elapsed (s)
