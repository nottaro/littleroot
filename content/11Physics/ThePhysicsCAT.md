## Reflection and Refraction with Reference to Huygen’s Principle

Huygen’s principle states that each point on a wavefront (imaginary plane that represents the points of a wave that vibrate in unison) is a source of spherical wavelets that spread out int the forwards direction at a constant speed as the wavefront progresses.

### Reflection

We can see that in the diagram, the wave strikes the surface and reflects. However, the incident wavefront hits at different points in time, and thus the wavefront must be deflected at different times as well. Here, we can see that it abides by the law of reflection, that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. The wave therefore retains all properties and returns to its original medium, such that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, and $\theta = \alpha$

### Refraction

As a wave passes through the medium, depending on the density of the medium, it increases or decreases in speed, does not travel as far, and therefore changes its angle based on this. The wave-front therefore changes direction due to this.  However, we can see that the wavefront again hits at different points in time, and therefore parts of the wavefront are refracted at a time, while the wave is refracted as well.

In the diagram, the incident wavefront intersects at angle $\theta$ from the normal.The wavefront enters the medium, and change speed due to the different density of the medium. Thus, the wavefront and wave refracts at angle $\alpha$ from the normal, and in this case, decreases in speed due to an increase in density, and angles towards the normal. The speed and wavelength both decreases due to an increase in density, with frequency remaining constant.

## Snell’s Law of Refraction and Critical Angle

### Snell’s Law

Refraction occurs when a wave passes from the medium to another, at an angle other than 90˚ and changes direction. Its speed changes, and therefore its wavelength, but not its frequency.

Snell’s Law of Refraction is a law stating the relation between the angles of refraction and incidence with respect to light passing through mediums, and states that the incident ray, normal, and refracted ray are co-planar. A refractive index is a property of a medium that determines how much the ray is refracted. It is equal to: $$n=\frac{c}{v}$$
where **n** is the refractive index, **c** is the speed of light in a vacuum and **v** is the velocity of the wave in the refracting medium

The law also states that the ratio of the sine of angle of incidence and the sine of angle of refraction is always constant for a given pair of media. 

The equation is as follows:

$$
n_1sin(\theta_1)=n_2sin(\theta_2) ∴n_{21}=\frac{sin(\theta_1)}{sin(\theta_2)}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}=\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}=\frac{v_1}{v_2}
$$

Where $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction, $v_1$ is the incidence velocity and $v_2$ is the refraction velocity, and $n_1$ is the 1st media’s refractive index, and $n_2$ is the 2nd media’s refractive index. $n_{21}$ represents the constant refractive index.

Note: the medium refraction for air is considered to be 1.000

### Critical Angle

The critical angle can be defined as the angle of incidence where the angle of refraction is 90˚. In other words, the wave does not pass through the boundary of the 2 mediums, and is instead refracted along the boundary, i.e. parallel to it. If the wave travels from a rarer medium to a denser medium, it will refract towards the normal, and therefore the critical angle is not observed. Thus, the critical angle only occurs when the wave travels from a denser to a rarer medium.

The critical angle can also be described as the largest incident angle that can be if there is refraction. 

By deriving Snell’s law, we can say that the equation for the critical angle is:

$$
\theta_{critical}=sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2}{n_1})
$$

Such that $n_2 > n_1$

Here, we would say that the critical angle is angle $\theta$ from the normal

## Ultrasound Imaging

Ultrasound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves, with a frequency of between 1000 to 20000 Hz. This is above the human hearing. 

Ultrasound imaging is a form of medical imaging that uses ultrasound waves to create an image of internal body structures, e.g. organs. The most common use of this is for pregnancy, to have an ultrasound image of the baby.

Ultrasound waves are used in medical imaging for a few reasons. One reason is that since they are outside the audible range, they don’t cause discomfort to the patient. Another reason is that ultrasound waves have very high frequencies, which produce a better resolution as they diffract less. Therefore, their intensity is maintained for longer distances, and more superficial structures can be imaged.

The process of ultrasound imaging can be described as such:

1. A transducer generates pulses as it moves along the surface of the tissue. The pulses travel through a conductive gel and into the tissue, and 3 things happen.
2. Wave’s Journey
    1. The waves lose intensity and energy due to absorption as they travel further into the tissue. Therefore their amplitude decreases as they travel into the tissue.
    2. The ultrasound waves reflect at the intermedia between 2 tissue
    3. The ultrasound waves have a possibility to refract, causing a change in the ultrasound wave speed and wavelength
3. The reflected waves arrive at the transducer
4. The distance between interfaces is calculated using the angle of return and time take to return
    1. This is because of $s=vt$, and the law of reflection
5. A grey scale image is produced, using their intensity
    1. Greater intensity of reflected light means a whiter image, thus denser objects appear brighter than rarer objects
6. An image that shows the boundaries of various structures and their density is created, and is known as a sonogram
