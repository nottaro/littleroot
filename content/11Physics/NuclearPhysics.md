## **Atoms**
-   Central part of an atom is the nucleus
-   Consists of:
	-   Neutrons
		-   No charge: 0
		-   Relative Atomic Mass: 1
	-   Protons
		-   Positive Charge +
		-   Relative Atomic Mass: 1
-   Collectively called nucleons
-   Almost identical in mass and size
-   Most of an atom is empty space that is only occupied by electrons
-   Any change in the amount of protons changes the element 
-   Electrons
	-   Negative Charge: -
	-   Relative Atomic Mass: 1/1836
	-   Orbit nucleus at high speeds
$$^A_ZX$$
A: Mass number
-   No. of Neutrons + No. of Protons
Z: Atomic number 
-   Number of protons in the atom

## **Isotopes**
-   All atoms of a particular element have the same amount of protons
-   However, they may have a different amount of neutrons
-   Isotopes are chemically identical to each other
-   They react and bond with other atoms in the exact same
-   Number of neutrons does not affect in which an atom interacts with other atoms
-   It is the electrons that determine this
-   It affects the physical properties
-   More neutrons in the atom means that the atom will be more dense
-   When referring to a particular nucleus, we refer to it as a “nuclide”
-   In this case, we ignore the presence of the electrons

## **Radioisotopes**
-   Most of the atoms that make up the world are stable
-   Their nuclei have not changed, and will not change independently
-   However there are also naturally occurring isotopes that are unstable
-   An unstable nucleus may spontaneously lose energy by emitting a particle
-   They change into a different element or isotope
-   Unstable atoms are radioactive
-   An individual **radioactive isotope** is called a **radioisotope**
-   Nearly all elements found in the Earth’s crust have naturally occurring isotopes
-   Over 2000 known radioisotopes, most of which are artificially produced

## **Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Radiation**
-   Around 100 years ago as of 2022, Ernest Rutherford and Paul Villard discovered that there were 3 different types of emission from radioactive substances
-   They called these **Alpha, Beta and Gamma Radiation**
-   Further experiments showed that the alpha and beta emissions were actually particles expelled from the nucleus
-   Gamma radiation was found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation, also emanating from the nucleus
### **Alpha Decay: $\alpha$**
-   When a heavy nucleus undergoes radioactive decay, it may eject an alpha particle
-   Alpha particle: positively charged chunk of matter
-   Consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons
-   Ejected from nucleus of a radioactive atom
-   Ionising ability: ability to create ions
	- High ionising ability, as it has a high positive charge, and can displace electrons from other atoms
	- Since it is positively charged, it collides with a lot of other atoms and loses energy, dislodging electrons from those atoms
-   An alpha particle is identical to a helium nucleus 
-   Very massive
-   Heavily charged
-   Usually from heavy elements
$$^4_2 He^{2+}$$
$$^4_2 \alpha ^{2+}$$
**Example**
Uranium-238 is radioactive and may decay by emitting an alpha particle from its nucleus. This can be represented in a nuclear equation where the changes occurring in the nuclei can be seen. Electrons are **not considered** in these equations, only nucleons. The equation for the alpha decay of uranium-238 is: $$^{238}_{92}U ->^{234}_{90}Th+^4_2 He^{2+}+energy$$
In the decay process, the parent nucleus **238-92-U** has spontaneously emitted an alpha particle (⍺) and has changed into a completely different element, **234-90-Th.** Thorium-234 is called the daughter nucleus. The energy released is mostly kinetic energy carried by the fast-moving alpha particle. When an atom changes into a different element, it is said to have undergone a **nuclear transmutation**. In nuclear transmutations, electric charge is conserved—seen as a conservation of atomic number In the example, 90+2 = 92. The number of nucleons  is also conserved; 234+4 = 238.

## **Beta Decay**
-   Beta particles are electrons
-   Originated from **nucleus** of a radioactive atom 
-   Not from electron cloud
-   Can be written as:
$$^0_{-1}e^{-}$$
$$^0 _{-1}\beta ^-$$
  

-   The atomic number of -1 indicates that it has a single negative charge
-   Mass number of 0 indicates its mass is far less than a proton or neutron
-   Beta decay occurs in nuclei where there is an imbalance of neutrons to protons
-   Typically, if a light nucleus has too many neutrons to be stable, a neutron will spontaneously change into a proton
- Ionising ability is medium
	- Since it is negatively charged, it is repelled by the electron cloud of other atoms
	- Experiences a large number of collisions, but expends less energy from them
	- Therefore less ionising
-   Electron and a uncharged massless particle called an **antineutrino** are ejected to restore the nucleus to a more stable state
- Antineutrino is symbolised as $\overline{V}$ 

**Example**
Isotopes of carbon: **C-12-6, C-13-6 and C-14-6**. Carbon-12 and 13 are both stable, but carbon 14 is unstable. It has more neutrons, and therefore undergoes a beta decay to be stable. In the process, one of the neutrons changes into a proton. As a result, the proton number increases to 7, and so the product is not carbon. Nitrogen-14 is formed. The nuclear equation for this decay is: $$^{14}_{6}C-> {^{14}_{6}N}+{^0_{-1}e+ \overline{V}+energy}$$The transformation taking place in the nucleus is: $$^1_0n->^1_0p+^0_{-1}e+ \overline{V}$$
-   n: neutrons
-   p: protons
-   e: beta particle
Once again, notice how in all these equations, the atomic and mass numbers are conserved. The antineutrino has no charge and has so little mass that both its atomic and mass numbers are 0

### Beta Decay (Positrons)
- A different form of beta decay occurs in atoms that have too many protons
- A proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (β+). This is known as a β+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron
- Positrons have the same properties as electrons, but their electrical charge is positive rather than negative. Positrons are an example of antimatter.

**Example**
The radioactive decay of unstable nitrogen-12. There are 7 protons and 5 neutrons in the nucleus, and a proton may change into a neutron, emitting a neutrino and a positively-charged beta particle (β+). This is known as a β+ (beta-positive) decay and the positively charged beta particle is called a positron. The equation is: $${^{14}_{6}N}->^{14}_{6}C+{^0_{+1}e+ \overline{V}+energy}$$

### Gamma Decay
- Generally, after a radioisotope has emitted an alpha/beta particle, the daughter nucleus holds an excess of energy
- The protons and neutrons in the daughter nucleus then rearrange slightly and offload this excess energy by releasing gamma radiation (high-frequency electromagnetic radiation)
- Ionising ability is low
	- Interact with matter infrequently when they collide directly with the nucleus or an electron
	- Low density of the atom makes this infrequent, therefore it cannot dislodge electrons as much as beta particles
	- Low ionisation ability
- Gamma rays—like all light—have no mass and are uncharged
- However, it contains a lot of energy
- Symbol is: $$^0_0 \gamma$$
- Being a form of light, gamma rays travel at the speed of light
- Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation/waves, and have the shortest wavelength
- They are photons

**Example:**
A common example of a gamma ray emitter is iodine-131. Iodine-131 decays by beta and gamma radiation to form xenon-131. The equation for this is: $$^{131}_{53}I->{^{131}_{54}Xe+^0_{-1}e+^0_0 \gamma}$$
**These equations can also be written with $\alpha,\beta$ or $\gamma$ written over the reaction arrow**

## Electromagnetic Waves
-   Form of energy that emits in waves
-   Transfers energy without transferring matter
-   Can pass through vacuums
-   Shorter the wavelength, higher the frequency
-   This energy is mainly expressed as light, but can be expressed as heat or electricity
-   Radiation can be emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves (gamma rays)

## **Half Life**
-   When a radioactive element decays, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time
-   The time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to half its original amount is called its half-life

## **Nuclear Fission**
-   Nucleus of an atom is bombarded with neutrons to split the heavier nucleus into smaller and lighter nuclei
-   This makes the nucleus so unstable that it splits into 2
-   A lot of energy is released
-   Occur artificially
-   Little energy is required to split an atom
-   Atomic bomb is based on concept of nuclear fission
-   Often involves releases of gamma rays and free neutrons
$$^1_0n+ ^{235}_{92}U->^{141}_{56}Ba+^{92}_{36}Kr+3 ^1_0 n$$

## **Nuclear Fusion**
-   2 or more lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus
-   An enormous amount of energy is released, much larger than nuclear fission
-   Occurs in stars and the sun
-   Huge amount of energy is required to bring 2 atoms together
-   Therefore, happens in very, very hot conditions
-   Cold fusion is a concept that entails nuclear fusion happening at room temperature
-   Hydrogen bomb is based on concept of nuclear fusion
-   Usually releases neutrons or protons as well as new nucleus![](Info%20Images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%203.46.43%20pm.png)![](Info%20Images/Fission%20&%20Fusion.png)
- Strong magnetic field is required for magnetic confinement
- Ensures plasma doesn’t escape
- Confinement ensures that fusion occurs, and makes it safe

## **Mass defect**
-   The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the combined masses of the nucleons
-   Mass defect: difference between total mass of the individual nucleons, and the mass of the nucleus as a whole 
-   The difference in mass is considered to be the **binding energy** of the nucleus
-   We can calculate the energy through $e=mc^2$
-   e = energy in J
-   m = mass in kg
-   c = speed of light, or 300 000 000 m/s

## **Binding Energy**
-   The difference in mass (mass defect) is considered to be binding energy
-   If the mass of 4He was equal to the mass of 2 protons + 2 neutrons, the nucleus would fall apart without any input of energy
-   To be stable, its mass must be less than that of its constituents combined 
-   The nuclear binding energy represents the amount of energy that must be put into a nucleus to break it apart into its individual nucleons

## **Nuclear Energy**
1.  Element is bombarded with neutrons
2.  Neutrons are absorbed
3.  Nucleus becomes unstable and splits into smaller nuclei, radioactive energy and lone neutrons

### **Nuclear Power Stations**
**Pros**
-   Energy efficient
-   Small land footprint
-   Average nuclear power plant producing 2000 MW takes up a square mile of space
-   Very powerful, energy wise
-   Reliable
-   Produce their maximum power output 93% of the time
-   Very stable
-   Produces no greenhouse gases
**Cons**
-   Closely connected to nuclear weapon technology production/proliferation
-   Dangerous to society
-   Nuclear waste
-   Extremely poisonous products
-   Takes 10s of 1000s of years to stop being radioactive/poisonous
-   Possibility of nuclear accidents
-   Uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions
-   Neutrons from fission reaction create another fission reaction
-   Causes excess of energy in the form of heat
-   Sometimes the heat is too much for the reactor to handle
-   It melts, and radioactive waste is expelled
-   Expensive to set up
-   Uranium is expensive

**Nuclear Power Station Components**
-   Fuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium
-   Moderator: material that slows down neutrons
-   Graphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide
-   Heavy water is the best but is too expensive
-   Water with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen
-   Graphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen
-   Ensures that neutron capture occurs
-   When the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy
-   Control rods: material that absorbs neutrons
-   Boron steel or cadmium
-   Ensures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission
-   Coolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down
	-   e.g. water
-   Radiation shield: thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor![](Info%20Images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%208.00.46%20pm.png)

## **Uses of Radiation**
### **Medical Tracers**
-   Radioactive substance injected into the body
-   Usually iodine, as it is absorbed by the thyroid gland
-   They measure the gamma radiation emitted to track pathways or image the body
-   Gamma is used as it is very penetrative (easier to measure from surface), and is less deadly in equal amounts (from the inside) than alpha and beta
### **Industrial Tracers**
-   Radioactive substance used in factories/industrial use
-   Much the same concept as a medical tracer
-   Injected into the system
-   Finds leaks in systems, or tracks certain chemicals
-   You can use a radioactive tracer if any escapes
### **X-Rays**
-   Electromagnetic waves are directed at the area of concern
-   A material is placed behind the area
-   The x-ray penetrates your body and into the area
-   They image the shadows in the area to find out what’s wrong
-   The bones absorb the x-ray, making this very useful, as we can see shadows, of the bone, or we can observe the brighter sections to view the muscles
### **Radiometric/Carbon Dating**
-   Radioactive dating uses the known half-life of an isotope and its composition to determine the age of a specimen
-   The most common is carbon dating, but that’s only good for 40-50000 years
-   When an archeological specimen is created in its time, it will mostly be carbon 14, but will slowly, over thousands of years, decay into nitrogen 14
-   By measuring how much nitrogen/carbon 14 is present, we can very accurately determine the age of the specimen by comparing it to the carbon-12 levels of living things
-   Carbon has a half life of 5730 years
-   Since it’s only good for 40-50000 years, it’s good for measuring the age of human artefacts and similar things, but useless for determining things in the millions, e.g. dinosaur fossils, ancient rock formations
-   For this, we use the decay of uranium into lead, which takes around 4.5 billion years
-   By measuring how much lead is present, we can also determine the age of this specimen![](Info%20Images/Contamination.png)
