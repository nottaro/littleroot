2.  Indirect tax
    1.  Tax on Goods/Services
        1.  Paid indirectly to the government via the sellers of the good
        2.  Taxed on profit, not revenue
    2.  Specific tax
    3.  Ad valorem tax
        1.  Example is General Sales Tax (GST)

## Indirect Tax

### ******Specific Tax******

-   Good or service is taxed a fixed amount per unit
    -   e.g. $5 per kg
-   Hence, tax per unit of the good is the same regardless the price of the good
-   Specific tax imposes a parallel shift **(of the supply curve)** upwards by the full amount of the tax

### ****************************Ad Valorem Tax****************************

-   Good or service is taxed a ********************percentage******************** based on the **********value********** of the product
    -   e.g. 7% GST
-   Hence, the higher the price of the good, the higher the tax per unit of the good will be
-   Pivots the supply curve upwards, i.e. skewed upwards

Taxes on a demand and supply curve **only affects the supply curve**

## Effects of Taxation

1.  **Impact** of a tax
    1.  Falls on the person on whom the tax is first levied
    2.  i.e., seller gets it first
2.  ******************Incidence****************** of a tax
    1.  Refers to the eventual distribution of the tax burden (i.e., who ultimately bears the tax)

****************Example:****************

1.  Government levies tax on producer
2.  Impact of tax is on producer
3.  Incidence of tax is shared between producer and consumer
