## Markets

-   Where Buyers and Sellers meet in order to exchange money for goods
    -   They do not always meet in person
-   Goods can be bought by consumers and sold by suppliers in online markets, e.g., Amazon
-   Amount of money a consumer pays the supplier in exchange for a good/service is called the **********price**********
-   There are markets for the factors of production
-   Labour is needed by producers to make goods
-   The producers are the buyers of labour and individual people are the sellers of their own labour

### Product Markets

-   Product markets deal with the buying/selling of goods and services
-   Consumers represent the demand side of the market, while producers/firms represent the supply side
-   Firms produce goods and services and sell them to households (consumers)

### Factor Markets

-   Deal in the buying and selling for factors of production or resources
    -   E.g., labour market
-   In a factor market, households sell their resources to firms
-   Households represent the supply side of the market
-   Firms represent the demand side

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Markets can also be classified according to the intensity of competition in the market****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Competitive Markets

-   Large number of buyers and sellers
-   Firms are price takers (no power over price), must take price established by market
-   Very similar (homogenous) products
-   Easy entry into market (no barriers to entry or exit)
-   Price is determined by the interaction between buyers and sellers
-   No individual buyer or seller can influence the market price
    -   No market power

### Imperfect Market

-   Not competitive
-   A.k.a. non-competitive market
-   Small number of firms
-   Product differentiation
-   Firms are price setters, can set their own price
    -   They have market power
-   Entry into market is restricted (barriers to entry), makes it harder to have competition
-   E.g. Mobile Phones, Water Corporation
-   Monopoly, Oligopoly
    -   Monopoly: One seller or producer is the sole supplier of a good/service in a market
    -   Oligopoly: Small number of firms, none of which can keep the others from having significant influence. **I.e.**, a few sellers/producers are the sole suppliers of a good/service in a market
-   Firms try to make their products look “different” in their consumer’s eyes

# Demand

-   Amount of a good/service consumers are willing and able to buy in a given period of time at a given price, ceteris paribus
    -   Ceteris paribus: other things remaining constant
-   A.k.a. **effective demand**
-   _**Law of Demand:**_ Quantity demanded of a product is inversely related to its price, in a given period of time, ceteris paribus
-   ************************************Individual Demand:************************************ Demand for a good or service by an individual consumer
-   ****Market Demand:**** Sum of the individual demand for a good or service by all of the consumers in the market

1.  Demographic Changes, e.g. size/composition of population
2.  Changes in expectations about future price changes
3.  Changes in Consumer’s Money income
4.  Changes in Price/Demand of related goods
