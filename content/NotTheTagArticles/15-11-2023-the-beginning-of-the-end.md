So. Here we are.

I'm officially/unofficially??? a year 12.

We've got our leaver's jackets

We're learning the Year 12 content.

I don't know how to feel

It's a bit surreal, if I'm being honest

I find myself wanting to treasure each and every friend I have

and dread the day when we all go




I'll just have to work harder and have more fun

Time flies so fast
