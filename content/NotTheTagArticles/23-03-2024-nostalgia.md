[go back](Articles.md)

well. i'm a third of the way through year 12.

it's been a long ride.

i didn't really like year 9/10, but i wouldn't change anything about it.

i feel that ultimately, it shaped me into a better person.

i met one of my primary school teachers a few weeks ago. she was always one of my favourites. she said i had a "lovely patient demeanour". and when i look back at that naive child in year 2 who used to play yu-gi-oh with his friends loudly and boisterously every lunchtime....i feel that i've grown up.

it's...kinda sad. i can never relive those moments.

i miss my younger self. the kid who would play beyblades every recess.

the kid who would read all the books in the library.

the kid who would run back home just to read more books.


i've changed. hopefully for the better. 

and hopefully, my younger self is proud of who i am today.
