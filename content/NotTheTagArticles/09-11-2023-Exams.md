**the exams test you on everything they've taught you in class, and adapt to bypass your knowledge and critical thinking**

**once it adapts to your knowledge, it doesn't stop there**

**it continues to adapt furtherr**

**what i wanted from the exams was a model**

**a model that would bypass your critical thinking**

**after adapting the exams just made the questions longer**

**that's not something i could do**

**so i waited**

**i waited for it to discover an adaptation to counter your critical thinking**

**the second adaptation was exactly what i anticipated, but it wasn't just makiong harder problems, like i do**

**instead, it created problems that used mental math**

**these did not target the specific knowledge or critical thinking, but rather the thinking as a whole**

**your knowledge and critical thinking meant nothing - as long as you thought, you would fail**

**it was quite difficult to pull off, but very effective**
