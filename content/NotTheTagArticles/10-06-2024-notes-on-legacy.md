with regards to [spicata's article](https://spicata.github.io/pressg/posts/08-06-2024_leaving_a_legacy)

**would you rather own a company that earns 1.5 million a year or get a nobel prize?**

1.5 mill, easy

think of the money i could make

think of the sheer power i'd have, to be able to not do anything, but do everything

i could overthrow the mere concept of a Nobel prize

"a million in the grand scheme of things isn't much" - ccc

yeah ok, you also chose my option, so there's some merit to it

anyway, make your own legacy frfr

don't rely on some random ass reward just to give u money

make your own money

like by getting 1.5 mill a year!!!!!!!

anyway imagine the sheer aura you'd have if you say you started up a company marketing.....i dunno, giant unicorns for old people

and you get 1.5 mil a year

"hello sharks, i'd like to present-"

it'd be so funny

overthrow the economy
