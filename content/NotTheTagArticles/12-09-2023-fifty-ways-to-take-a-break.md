It was Wellness Week last week, so I thought I'd publish this.

Hopefully this helps you get away from everything, and relax. It helped me.

###### 1. Take a bath 🛁
You can just take a few minutes to soak(get it?) everything in, and maybe think. Warm water helps you relax.

###### 2. Listen to music 🎧
This calms you down a ton. Try not to listen to catchy songs, stick mostly to instrumentals, classical music and/or lofi. If you really want lyrics, just listen to acoustic songs.

###### 3. Take a nap 🛌
Sleep is good. Maybe you'll wake up with a fresh perspective of things.

###### 4. Go to a body of water 🌊
Swim. Just relax. There's something about the sound of flowing/splashing water that just calms you down.

###### 5. Watch the clouds ☁️
Lose yourself in the sky, and let your imagination run free.

###### 6. Light a candle 🕯️
Scented candles smell so nice, and calm you down.

###### 7. Rest your legs up on a wall 🦵🏼
Just gives you a sense of relaxation and detachment.

###### 8. Let out a sigh 😮‍💨
Lets you express yourself without screaming. Also, it's really relaxing.

###### 9. Fly a kite 🪁
A really fun activity. Just you, the kite, and a nice, warm, windy day.

###### 10. Watch the stars ✨
Get lost in the night sky. Maybe you'll see a shooting star, and make a wish. Just you, and the cool night air and sky.

###### 11. Write a letter 💌
Just writing is nice. Maybe you could contact an old friend.

###### 12. Learn something new 📚
Distract yourself with something. Find a new hobby. Maybe you'll be good at it, maybe not. Just learn, for learning's sake.

###### 13. Listen to a guided relaxation 🧎
Meditate. Contemplate. Think.

###### 14. Read a book 📖
Find a new book. Maybe a new genre. You might learn something new.

###### 15. Sit in nature 🌲
Fresh air. The sunlit grass. Very calming. Hug a tree!

###### 16. Move twice as slowly 🐌
I feel like this would be really relaxing. Take a breath. Slow down.

###### 17. Take deep belly breaths 💨
Relax. Let the air flow through you. Take in the world around you.

###### 18. Meditate 🧘
Just think, and contemplate. Feel.

###### 19. Call a friend 📱
Maybe talking to them will cheer you up. Anyway, just talking about insignificant things is nice.

###### 20. Meander around town 🏘️
Maybe you'll find something new.

###### 21. Write in a journal 📝
It's important to note down your thoughts. Maybe you could learn from yesterday's mistakes.

###### 22. Notice your body 👀
Self love is important.

###### 23. Buy some flowers 🌸
The scent might calm you down. Maybe you need a bright spot in your life.

###### 24. Find a relaxing scent 👃
Pretty self-explanatory. I find jasmine/rose works for me.

###### 25. Walk outside 🚶
Take in nature. Look at the outside world. 

###### 26. Go for a run 👟
Exercise is healthy.

###### 27. Take a bike ride 🚴
It's faster than running.

###### 28. Pet a furry creature 🐶
Floof go fluff.

###### 29. Create your own coffee break ☕️
Coffee is actually very relaxing (despite the caffeine). Just drink decaf if you can't handle it.

###### 30. View some art 🎨
See the world as others have.

###### 31. Eat a meal in silence 🌮
Just appreciate the food and taste.

###### 32. Turn off all electronics 📵
It's surprising how much social media can stress you out. Just take a break.

###### 33. Go to a park 🏞️
Again. Nature is good. Just breath in the scenery.

###### 34. Go to a farmer's market 🍎
Actually really fun. Just have a look around. Maybe you'll find something you like.

###### 35. Forgive someone 💔
It's good to let go sometimes. But remember, not all the time. That pain is what makes us human.

###### 36. Read or watch something funny 🤣
Laughing will make you feel better.

###### 37. Examine an everyday object with fresh eyes 😍
Considering other perspectives is good.

###### 38. Drive somewhere new 🚗
Exploring is fun! Make sure you have a parent/guardian if you don't have your license yet!

###### 39. Colour with crayons 🖍️
Bright colours cheer you up!

###### 40. Make some music 🎶
Who knows? You could be the next Stevie Wonder.

###### 41. Climb a tree 🌳
Unless you're afraid of heights. Then again, that's even more of a reason to try something new!

###### 42. Let go of something 🎈
Physically (try not to break anything) or metaphorically, it's fine either way. 

###### 43. Engage in small acts of kindness 🥰
Treat others the way you want to be treated. Doing good deeds makes you feel good.

###### 44. Do some gentle stretches 🙆
It'll help relax your body.

###### 45. Paint on a surface other than paper 🖌️
The texture could feel nice.

###### 46. Write a quick poem ✍️
Express yourself in new ways.

###### 47. Read Poetry 📗
View some new expressions!

###### 48. Put on some music and dance 💃
Move around! Go crazy!

###### 49. Give thanks ❤️
It's important to acknowledge the people in your life

###### 50. Be yourself. 🫵
Above all, be yourself. No need to hurry. No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself.
