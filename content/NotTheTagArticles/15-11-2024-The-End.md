# work in progress go away

Well. It's been a journey.

12 long years, all for this moment.



Do I have any regrets?

Well.

Over the past 3 years, my social life actually started. 

I lived. 
I laughed. 
I cried.

And most importantly, I loved. 

I grew into a better version of myself. 


So long, friends. May we meet on the dusty, rocky road ahead. And while it is a journey many before have undertaken, I know that mine will be unlike any other.
