Well. It's been a journey.

12 long years, all for this moment.

Do I have any regrets?

Well. Quite a lot.

Over the past 3 years, my social life actually started. 

I lived. 
I laughed. 
I cried.

And most importantly, I loved. 

I grew into a better version of myself. 

Would I change anything? No.

Those events shaped me, and made me who I am today, and I'm proud of that. 

Hopefully, when my past self looks at me now, they'll be proud of they will be, and when my future self looks at me now, they'll be proud of who they used to be.

I'd like to thank so many people, but it's doubtful they'll see this, so I'll keep this to the members, current or not, of the town.

1. Spicata. You got me through the hardest of times, and made me laugh no matter the situation. You're an absolute blessing in my life.
2. Anonymous. I will always treasure our Unite games during study breaks. Spending time with you was always entertaining.
3. Tacoz. Again, you supported me so much, and I'll never forget our Chemistry classes together. You were always the highlight of my day, always managing to cheer me up.

Thank you so much. I doubt I'll ever be able to repay you, but I'll try.

So long, friends. May we meet on the dusty, rocky road ahead. And while it is a journey many before have undertaken, I know that mine will be unlike any other. 

Until next time!
