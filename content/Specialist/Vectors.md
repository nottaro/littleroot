# Vectors

-   Value with Direction and Magnitude

## Vector Diagrams

-   Vectors can be represented in a diagram
-   Arrows are used to represent vector quantities
-   Must be some vector on each side
-   Must be resolved

### Adding Vectors

******************************************For 2 Vectors A and B******************************************

![](Images/vec.png)

We can use the triangle method:
![](Images/tri.png)


and use the Cosine Rule to find the magnitude of side c:

$$ c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\times cos(C) $$

and the Sine rule to find the angle it makes from the x axis. They’ll usually give you another angle, to add to this value, as this is not connected to the x or y axis.

$$ \frac {sin(A)}{a}=\frac {sin(B)}{b}=\frac {sin(C)}{c} $$

where the capital letter is the angle opposite the lower-case letter
- E.g., angle **A** is opposite side **a**. 
This also works for the reciprocals of this equation.


We can also use the ******parallelogram method,****** and use the methods described above

There's also adding Vector Components, but I'll cover that later

## Vectors in Euclidean Geometry

-   Line segments are geometrical objects
    
-   $AB$ is the magnitude
    
-   $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is a vector
    
-   $\overline{AB}$ is a line segment
    
-   ABCD is a parallelogram
    
 ![](Images/para%202.png)
    
-   $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ are different line segments because, on the cartesian plane, their coordinates are different
    
    -   $\therefore \overline{AD}≠\overline{BC}$
-   $\overrightarrow{AD}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$ are the same vector, as they have the same magnitude and direction
    
    -   $\therefore \overrightarrow{AD}=\overrightarrow{BC}$
-   Vectors don’t have a fixed location!
    
-   Think of vectors as properties of (directed) line segments
    
-   Addition of vectors in geometry:
    

$$ \overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}+\overrightarrow{CD}+\overrightarrow{DE}+\overrightarrow{EF}=\overrightarrow{AF} $$

## Abstract Vectors

-   Vectors can be represented abstractly as mathematical objects which obey certain rules
-   They can be notated as lowercase letters in bold
    -   **a**
-   Or underlined
    -   $\underline{a}$

### Mathematical Rules for Abstract Vectors

****************Equality****************

-   2 vectors are equal if and only if their magnitudes are equal and their directions are equal
-   Same magnitude, same direction are “like” vectors
-   Same magnitude, different directions are “unlike” vectors
-   Same direction, different magnitude are “like” vectors
-   2 vectors that are parallel, but in opposite directions, are “unlike” vectors

******************The Negative of a Vector******************

-   For a vector **a**, the vector **-a** has the same magnitude but an opposiute direction

$$ -\overrightarrow{AB}=\overrightarrow{BA} $$

******************************************Scalar Multiplication******************************************

-   Given a vector $a$, $2a=a+a$
-   For a vector **a**, and positive scalar $k$(i.e., a positive real number), the vector k**a** is the vector with the same direction as **a** and magnitude k|**a**|
-   For a negative $k$,$ka=k|-a|$

**********Subtracting Vectors**********

-   Think of **$a-b=a+(-b)$**

$$ \overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}-\overrightarrow{DC}=\overrightarrow{AD} $$

************The Zero Vector************

-   The zero vector **$0$** has magnitude 0 and an ******************undefined****************** direction

## Vectors in Component Form

-   Any 2D vector can be resolved into a sum of horizontal and verticale components, written as $a$$**\underline{i}$$+b$**$\underline{j}$, where **i** and **j** are unit vectors
-   Vectors in component form can be added by adding their components and simplifying

$$ a\underline{i}+b\underline{j}+c\underline{i}+b\underline{j}=(a+c)\underline{i}+(b+d)\underline{j}

$$

-   A vector ****v**** can be written in component form as

$$ \underline{v}=|\underline{v}|\ cos\ \theta\ \underline{i}+|\underline{v}|\ sin\ \theta \ \underline{j}

$$

-   Given a vector $\underline{v}=a\underline{i}+b\underline{j}$

: - $|\underline{v}|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ - $tan\ \theta=\frac{b}{a}$ - Your calculator will evaluate this with an angle between $-90˚$and $90˚$ - This may not match the quadrant of the vector! If not, add $180˚$ - If the vector is in the 4th quadrant, your calculator will give a negative angle. Add $360˚$to get the equivalent positive angle
