- Electrocution: Harm caused by an electric current passing through the body
	- For this to occur, 2 things must happen
		1. Electrical contact: there must be complete non-disrupted electrical contact between you, the source, and the ground (sometimes dual contact with source). This means electricity can flow through your body (from the source) and into the ground/source again and a complete circuit is achieved
		2. Potential Difference: there must be a potential difference between the electrical source and the end point (i.e. the ground). If there is no potential difference between the 2 points of contact, electricity will not flow through your body
- Thermal Shock: a type of electrocution where damage is caused by the generation of heat as the electric current bypasses through the body's resistance
- Electric shock: A type of electrocution where damage is caused by the outside electrical currents upsetting and disturbing the small electrical currents in the body, causing damages to organs, and possible heart failure
- If a circuit is live, there is current flowing through it
- A short circuit is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low electrical impedance.Â This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.

## Safety Devices
- Devices that prevent electrocution
- Prevent electrical leakage or completion of a circuit
- short circuit: overflow of current in a system

### Fuses
- Wires made of extremely low melting point alloys that prevent electrical devices from overloading with current
- When a short circuit occurs (because of bare wires touching): the circuit overloads with current (as resistance has decreased), and if the circuit is not disrupted, the high current causes excessive heat dissipation and eventually catches fire (due to friction)
- Fuses are specific components of the electrical circuits
- When a high current flows through the fuse, the fuse simply melts, disjoining the two wire segments adjacent to the fuse and thus breaking the circuit

### RCD - Residual Current Device
- A device that breaks a circuit if it detects current leaking from the circuit
- The RCD measures the current in the active (live) conductor that conducts electricity to an appliance and a neutral return conductor
- If there is an imbalance of current on the active and neutral wires, this indicates current may be leaking through the body of a person in contact with an energised device
- Any imbalance of currents (approximately 30 milliamps or more) between the active and neutral conductors causes the RCD to break the circuit within 20 to 24 milliseconds

### Double Insulation
- Type of insulation around the live/active part of a device (where current is flowing) that physically prevents contact with the energised part fo the device
	- E.g., plastic covering around the energised motors of a hairdryer
- Double insulation is mostly made of well insulated plastics

### Circuit Breakers
- Automatically operated electrical switches that protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overloading of circuits (usually caused by short-circuits)
- Once a fault is detected, the circuit breaker works like a switch to break the circuit, but unlike a fuse, the circuit breakers can be reset

### Earth Wires
- An earth wire exists to provide protection against a fault occuring in the appliance. The earth wire is connected to the metal casing of an appliance and the ground
1. In the case of a live wire coming loose and touching the meal, the entire appliance will become live (current runs through it)
2. If an earth wire is connected, a short circuit will occur, as the current will pass from the live metal to the wire and to the ground. Thus if a human touched the appliance, current will not flow through them, but directly to the ground
3. Thus, the earth wire protects the user
- Earth wires are commonly used in association with a fuse as due to the short circuit occurring, there will be a current overload leading to the fuse "blowing" and thus the circuit being broken

## Dr Waters Definitions

- Fuse: excess current will melt wire, break circuit and prevent house fire, but not death by electrocution
- Residual circuit devices (rcd): monitors for any difference in current between active and neutral wires, and if difference is detected then circuit is cut (tripped) in nano-seconds
	- Thus saves houses and lives
- Electrocution: harm caused by an electrical current
