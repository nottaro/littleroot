- By Joanna Murray-Smith
- Title: Kinda ominous, nothing is 'given', per se, you have to work for it
- The cover is a mirror, perhaps the gift is you
- The play starts off talking about friends, maybe the true gift was the friends we made along the way
- "It’s true though, isn’t it, you hit your thirties and you really don’t need any new friends. You start out friendless and you acquire to the point of saturation and you think to yourself: In order to be a good friend, I shouldn’t take on any more. I shouldn’t spread myself too thin"
- "To be honest, we started culling friends"
- **MARTIN:** If you neglect your children, you’re criminal
  **CHLOE:** But your friends
  **MARTIN:** It’s unpleasant, but it’s not illegal.
- "I’m usually a breast man but I take pleasure where I can get it."
	- Objectifying women
	- Devaluation of women
- "People can do without art though, can they"

## Interpretations and Ideas
- Representations of:
	- Class- notably the middle-class classism (attitudes, etc)
	- Gender (misogyny, sexism - and by extension patriarchy - consider how the play may challenge the attitudes/beliefs through ridicule, etc)
- Consumerism/materialism - banality/tedium of/lifestyle
- Self-obsession/narcissism - possibly even hedonism
- Art and expression - value/significance of
- Adult relationships - marriage, friendship, etc
- Parenting
- Nostalgia
- Other???

## Social Satire
- Works of literature, artm and even culture, that conventionally employ humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule, to critique social/political structures
- The purpose is to comment on, or all into question, figures, customs, traditions etc - something of a catalyst for change, or simple entertainment
- While now synonymous with "comedy" and "humour", ancient Greek and Roman satire was more so invective (e.g. insult or critical language)

### Types of Satire
- There are 3 main types of satire - each which serves a specific purpose/social function
- Juvenalian: Dark, rather than comedic. The purpose is to speak truth to power through considerably bitter and often ironic criticism
- Horatian: Comic and. offers light social commentary. The purpose is to poke fun at a person or situation in an entertaining way
- Menippean: Casts moral judgement upon a particular belief, e.g. homophobia or racism - i.e., attitudes rather than individuals or specific entities. This form can be comic and light, much light Horatian satire - although it can also be as stinging as Juvenalian Satire

## Research Task

### Absurdism (comedy)
- Also known as surreal humour
- Form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning thus producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical
- Concerned with building up expectations and then knocking them down; even seemingly masterful characters with the highest standards and expectations are subverted by the unexpected, which the scene emphasises for the viewer's amusement
- The unique social situations, expressed thoughts, actions, and comic lines are used to spark laughter, emotion, or surprise as to how the events occurred or unfolded, in ways sometimes favourable to other unexpectedly introduced characters

### Postmodernist Humour
- In postmodernism, the sense that everything has been done before gives way to relentless quoting and remakes, a context in which the only way to get noticed is to be ironic, to quote-not only words but also clothing and appearance styles.
- **Ironic quote marks**, i.e. quoting things ironically
	- An example would be dark humour, which is also prevalent in post-modernist humour
	- Quoting certain books/people
