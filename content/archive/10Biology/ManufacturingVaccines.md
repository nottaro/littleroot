### **Genetic Sequencing**
- High throughput has allowed screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to aid in vaccine development 
- It’s estimated that 10-100 times more candidates can be identified in 1-2 years using genomic-based approaches that can be identified by conventional methods in the same time frame
- **Steps:**
	1. Whole genome sequence of pathogen is obtained
	2. **Reverse Vaccinology**: sequence information identifies protein antigens for possible inclusion in vaccines
	3. **Pan-genomics**: comparison of sequence of related pathogens to ensure the chosen antigen covers the diversity of the organism
	4. **Comparative genomics**: comparison of sequence of related pathogens to identify antigens that are present in pathogenic strains but absent in non-pathogenic strains 

### **Genetic Engineering**
- Intentional modification of the genetic code of an organism using bio-technology
- Modifications include
	- Removing heritable material or
	- Introducing DNA using recombinant nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) techniques
- Hepatitis B vaccine is the only approved recombinant engineered vaccine approved for human use
- Most genetically engineered vaccines are:
	- Costly to manufacture and gain approval
	- Less immunogenic (causes less of an immune response) than conventional vaccines
	- Too specific with only 1 antigen present
