## **Innate Immunity**
- Based on genetic make-up
- Relies on already formed components
- Rapid response: within minutes of infection
- Not specific
	- Same molecules/cells respond to a range of pathogens
- Has no memory
	- Same response after repeated exposure
- Does not lead to clonal expansion
	- Clonal expansion: explosive increase in number of lymphocytes
### **Mechanisms**
- Mechanical barriers/surface secretion
	- Skin
	- Acidic pH in stomach
	- Cilia
- Humoral mechanisms (mediated by macromolecules, e.g. cells)
	- Lysosomes, basic proteins, complement, interferons 
- Cellular defence mechanisms
	- Natural killer cells
	- Neutrophils
	- Macrophages
	- Mast cells
	- Basophils 
	- Eosinophils


## **Adaptive Immunity**
- Based on resistance acquired during life
- Relies on genetic events and cellular growth
- Responds more slowly, over a few days
- Is more specific
	- Each cell responds to a single epitope on an antigen
- Has anamnestic memory
	- Repeated exposure leads to faster, stronger, response
- Leads to clonal expansion

### **Mechanisms**
- Cell-mediated immune response (CMIR)
	- T-lymphocytes
	- Eliminate intracellular microbes that survive within phagocytes or other infected cells
	- Doesn’t use antibodies
- Humoural Immune Reponse (HIR)
	- B-lymphocytes
	- - Mediated by antibodies
	- Eliminate extra-cellular microbes and their toxins

#### Cell-mediated immune response
1. T-Cell
	- Recognises peptide antigen on macrophage in association with major histo-compatibility complex (MHS) class
	- Identifies molecules on cell surface
	- Helps body distinguish self from non-self
2. T-cell goes into effectors cell stage that is able to kill infected cells
	- Activation of phagocytes, t-lymphocytes and cytokines in response to an antigen
	- Doesn’t involve antibodies

#### **Humoral Immune Response**

1. B lymphocytes recognise specific antigens
	- Proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells
2. Antigens bind to specific antigens on microbes: destroy microbes via specific mechanisms
3. Some B lymphocytes evolve into the resting state: memory cells
	- Mediated by macromolecules, e.g. antibodies, located in extracellular fluids
	- Uses antibodies

Once foreign antigen reaches the lymphoid tissue:

| Main Cells involved           | B-Cells                                                                                 | T-Cells                                                                                                                                                       |
| Where do cells develop        | Produced and mature in the bone marrow                                                  | Produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus gland                                                                                                    |
| Antibodies produced?          | YES                                                                                     | NO                                                                                                                                                            |
| How are pathogens identified? | Antigens in the blood                                                                   | Antigens on the surface of infected cells                                                                                                                     |
| How are pathogens killed?     | Antibodies combine with antigen (antibody-antigen complex) and destroy or inactivate it | Killer T-Cells destroy the antigen, helper T-cells promote phagocytosis, suppressor T-cells inhibit T- and B-cell activity when infection has been dealt with |

## **Immunisation** 
- Naturally acquired immunity is acquisition of adaptive immunity through natural events
- Immunisation mimics these events by inducing artificially acquired immunity
- Natural or artificial immunity can be divided into
	- Active immunity
	- Passive immunity

### **Active immunity**
- Immunity that is attained from exposure to an antigen/pathogen
- Results from immune response upon exposure to an antigen
- Active immunity can develop naturally
	- Following illness
- Or artificially
	- After immunisation
- Better than passive immunity
	- Body has already gone through the motion of defeating the pathogen
	- Don’t need to go through the infection itself, as vaccine has deactivated version of pathogen/virus


### **Passive Immunity**

- Immunity that is acquired from antibodies being introduced into the body from an external source
- Occurs naturally during pregnancy
	- IgG from mother crosses placenta
		- Infers protection to the baby
- Occurs naturally as a result of breast-feeding
	- IgA antibodies in breast milk given to child
- Artificial passive immunity involves transfer of antibodies produced by another person or animal
	- Can be used to prevent disease before or after likely exposure
