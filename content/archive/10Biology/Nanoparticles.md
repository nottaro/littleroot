- Nanoparticle-based vaccines (20-100 nm) aim to:
	- Deliver the vaccine molecules to the target site
	- Stimulate prolonged immune response
	- Cause minimal side effects
	- Require less doses for a sustained immune response
- **Nanoparticle Design**
	- Vaccine antigens can either be:
		- Decorated on the nanoparticle surface, or
		- Encapsulated within the nanoparticle
- Protects the antigen from premature degradation and elicit sustainable release of antigen
- **Targeting molecules** e.g. antibodies, aid in delivery of particles into the antigen presenting cells (APCs) to induce innate and adaptive immune responses
