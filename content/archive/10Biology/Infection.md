## **Ways Infectious Diseases Spread**

- Infectious disease can spread by
	- Direct or close contact 
		- Transmission within 1-2 meters
	- Indirect contact
		- Transmission outside of 1-2 meters 
		- Can be on surfaces
- Vectors (organisms that transmit pathogens from an infected host to a susceptible host)

### Direct Contact
- Person to person transmission (within 1-2 meters)
- Direct physical contact through kissing, touching, sexual intercourse, etc
- Droplet sprays
- Examples:
	- COVID-19, droplets and direct physical contact
	- EBOLA, direct contact with bodily fluids, semen
	- Note that both COVID-19 and EBOLA can be spread by both direct and indirect contact

### Indirect Contact
- Outside 1-2m
- Involves: 
	- Fomites (inanimate objects) become contaminated by pathogens from an infected individual. Transmission to new host via touch and entry into a susceptible portal (e.g. COVID-19)
	- Or spreading as aerosols (smaller particles that can travel further), e.g. COVID-19
- Some pathogens, e.g. measles virus, remain viable in the air for large amounts of time

  

### **Vectors**
- Diseases can also be transmitted by a vector
- Mechanical vectors
	- An animal (typically an arthropod) that carries the pathogen from one host to another without being infected itself, e.g., a bat
- Biological vector
	- The pathogen **reproduces** within a biological vector that transmits the pathogen from one host to another, e.g., mosquito (technically the malaria pathogen)

## **Controlling Infectious Diseases**
- Control of infectious diseases refers to the actions and programs aimed at:
	- Reducing the number of new infections
	- Reducing disease prevalence
	- Completely eradicating the disease
- This can be achieved by:
	- Physical precaution measures
	- Medication
	- Vaccines

### **Physical Precaution Measures**

#### **Washing hands**
- Hand washing with soap removes pathogens from hands
- This helps prevent infections because
	- People frequently touch their eyes, nose and mouth without even realising it
	- Pathogens can be transferred to food and drinks where they can potentially multiply and be ingested
	- Preventing spread by indirect contact where pathogens can be transferred to fomites, then to another person’s hands

#### **Wearing Gloves**
- Prevent contamination
- ONLY WORK WHEN USED CORRECTLY IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES
	- When cleaning and disinfecting the area around the person who is sick or other surfaces that may be frequently touched in the home
	- When touching or having contact with blood, stool, or bodily fluids, e.g. saliva, vomit, mucus, urine
- After using disposable gloves, dispose of them
- Wash hands after removing gloves

#### **Wearing Masks**
- Masks act as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from travelling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the masks sneezes, coughs, talks, or raises their voice
- Wash hands after handling a used mask
