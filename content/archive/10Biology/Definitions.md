**Pathogen:** An infectious micro-organism or other agent that causes disease

**Prokaryotic:** Cell that has no membrane-bound nucleus or membrane-bound organelles

**Eukaryotic:** Cell that has membrane-bound organism and membrane-bound organelles

**Disease:** Any condition that interferes with how an organism, or any part of it, functions

**Flagella:** a single thread-like structure on micro-organisms that allows them to move/swim

**Heterotroph:** Organism that doesn’t produce its own sustenance

**Autotroph:** Organism that produces its own sustenance, either by itself or from sunlight(photosynthesis, produces sugar from carbon dioxide, water and sunlight)

**Bacteria:** Single-celled organisms that are prokaryotic

**Virus:** Piece of genetic material (RNA or DNA) housed within a protective coat that is not a cell

**Protist:** Single or multi-cellular micro-organisms (eukaryotes) that aren’t plants, animals or fungi

**Fungi:** Single or multicellular eukaryotic organism with cell walls made of chitin, and reproduce using spores

**Infectious Disease:** Disease that can invade the body

**Contagious Disease:** Disease that can be spread from one organism to another

**Non-infectious Disease:** Disease cannot be spread from one organism to another

**Vaccination:** Administration of a material that stimulates adaptive immunity to a disease

**Health:** Physical condition of an organism, without being affected or infected by a pathogen or other condition

**Disease:** Abnormal condition of an organism resulting from various causes, e.g. infection

**Disorder:** Condition that affects the function of the mind or body

**Micro-organism:** Organism of microscopic or ultra-microscopic size

**Infection:** Invasion of an organism by a pathogen

**Virulence:** Pathogen’s or micro-organism’s ability to damage its host

**Endemic:** Limited to a particular location, region or people 

**Epidemic:** Limited to many individuals in a wide area, or a population

**Pandemic:** Occurring over a wide geographic area and usually affecting a large amount of the population

**Outbreak:** Sudden occurrences of a disease in a particular time or place

**Antigen:** something on the cell that is recognised by the immune system

**Antibody:** protein produced by the immune system which recognises the antigen, and can neutralise it

**Immunity:** resistance against a particular pathogen through the specific antibodies, lymphocytes or other immune system components
