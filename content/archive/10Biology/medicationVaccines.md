## **Antibiotics**
- Drugs that fight infections caused by bacteria e.g. Penicillin
- 2 types: 
- **Bactericidal Antibiotics**
	- Kill bacteria by disrupting:
		- Cell wall, cell membrane or action of essential enzymes
- **Bacteriostatic Antibiotics**
	- Prevent bacteria from reproducing usually by disrupting proteins synthesis
		- Broad spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of different types of bacteria
		- Narrow spectrum antibiotics only affect specific types of bacteria

## **Antivirals**
- Antivirals treat infections caused by viruses
- Work by inhibiting replication of the virus, e.g. acyclovir (Zorivax) for herpes infections

## Vaccines
- Contain antigens that trigger immunity but do not cause the disease
- Induce long-term immunity to specific pathogenic infections by stimulating production of memory cells
- Developed to have active artificial immunity

### **Attenuated vaccines**
- Weakened form of pathogen
	- Generally unable to cause disease
- Strain replicates in vaccine recipient
	- Causes infection with undetectable or mild symptoms
	- Results in long-lasting immunity
- **Advantages**
	- Single-dose usually sufficient to induce long-lasting immunity
		- Due to multiplication of microbe in body
		- Continued stimulation of immune system
	- Vaccine has added potential for being spread
		- “Disease“ after immunisation could be spread to un-immunised individuals inadvertently
- **Disadvantages**
	- Have potential to cause disease in immunocompromised individuals
	- Pregnant women should also avoid immunisation with attenuated vaccines
- Attenuated vaccines in use include:
	- Sabin polio vaccine
	- MMR
	- Yellow fever (jaundice)

### **Inactivated vaccines**
- Used killed or inactivated version of pathogen
- **Advantages**
	- Generally considered to be safe
	- Easy to manufacture
	- More stable than live vaccines
- **Disadvantages**
	- Immunity not as prolonged therefore boosters will be required for ongoing immunity against diseases
- E.g. Polio vaccine

### **Toxoid Vaccines**
- Use a toxin made by the pathogen
- Immune response targeted to the toxin instead of the whole pathogen
- **Advantages**
	- Toxoid vaccines are safe as long as they cannot cause the disease they prevent
	- Stable, less susceptible to changes in temperature, humidity and light
- **Disadvantages**
	- Immunity is not prolonged, may need booster shots for ongoing immunity 
- E.g., tetanus

### **Subunit Vaccines**
- Uses specific pieces of the pathogen to focus immune response to a specific target
- **Advantages**
	- Immune response that is targeted to key parts of the pathogen
	- Safe to use, even on immunocompromised people 
- **Disadvantages**
	- Immunity is not prolonged, may need booster shots for ongoing immunity
- E.g., HPV virus (Human Papillomavirus)

### **COVID-19 Vaccines**
- mRNA
	- Pfizer, BioTech
	- Moderna
- Viral Vector 
	- AstraZeneca
