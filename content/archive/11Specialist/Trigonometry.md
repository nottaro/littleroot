### Content you are assumed to know (from Methods)
- Angles in degrees in radians (and converting between units)
- Defining sin  and cos using the unit circle
- Graphs of y = sin x, y = cos x, and y = tan x
- The Pythagorean Identity
	- $sin^2 (x) + cos^2 (x) =1$
- Symmetry properties of trig functions
	- $sin (\theta) = sin (\pi - \theta)$
- Exact values of trig functions for integer multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6}$ radians

## Basic Trig Functions
$$sin(-\theta)=-sin(\theta)$$
$$cos (-\theta)=cos(\theta)$$
$$tan(-\theta)=-tan(\theta)$$
$$sin(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2})=cos(\theta)$$
$$cos(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2})=sin(\theta)$$
## General solutions to trig equations
- Remember that a trig equation such as $cos(\theta) = 0.3$ has infinitely many solutions
	- There are 2 solutions even in one revolution of the unit circle
	- However, a scientific calculator, if asked to evaluate $cos^{-1}(0.3)$ will only give one value
	- How does it decide which value to give?
- Inverse trig functions
	- By convention: $cos^{-1}$ has range $\{ \theta | 0 ≤ \theta ≤ \pi \}$
	- By convention: $sin^{-1}$ has range $\{ \theta | -\frac{π}{2} ≤ \theta ≤ \frac{π}{2}  \}$
	- By convention: $tan^{-1}$ has range $\{ \theta | -\frac{π}{2} < \theta < \frac{π}{2}  \}$

## Sums of Trig Identities
$$a \sin(x)+ b \cos(x))$$
$$ = \sqrt {a^2 + b^2} \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \sin(x) + \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \cos(x) \right)$$
$$= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \left( \cos (\alpha) \sin(x)+\sin(\alpha) \cos(x) \right)$$
$$= \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \sin(x+\alpha)$$

## Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions

$$\frac{1}{\cos \theta}= \sec \theta$$

$$\frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \text{cosec} \  \theta$$

- The functions above are basically asymptotes of their respective denominators, look at images online

$$\frac{1}{\tan \theta}= \cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$$

- Basically just a tan graph reflected over the y axis

## Pythagorean Identities
$$\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$$
