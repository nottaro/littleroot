## Measures of Economic Activity
- There are three ways to measure the value of aggregate output, suggested by the circular flow of income model, all giving rise to the same result:
- Expenditure approach - adds up all spending to buy final goods and services produced within a country over a time period
- Income approach - adds up all income earned by the factors of production that produce all goods and services within a country over a time period
- Output approach - calculates the value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a time period.

## National Income
- Measures the monetary value of the flow of output of goods and services produced in an economy over a period of time.
- Main function of National Income Accounting is to provide data to monitor the performance of the overall economy
- National Income of a country can be calculated in 3 ways
- The Output Approach
	- Value of all output produced
- The Income Approach
	- Sum of all incomes earned
- The Expenditure Approach
	- Sum of expenditure incurred

### The Production or Output Approach
- Adding up all the money values of all FINAL goods & services produced in the country.
- OR: SUMMING up the VALUE-ADDED by all industries in the economy over a period of time, usually a year

### The Income Approach
- Adding up all the EARNINGS of owners of FOPs & resources over a period of time, usually a year
- Returns to FOP
	- Rent (Land)
	- Wages (Labour)
	- Interest (Capital)
	- Profits (Enterprise)
- Sum of all the earnings of owners of FOPs & resources over a period of time, usually a year
	- National Income = W + R + I + P

### The Expenditure Approach
- Sum of the spending by households, firms, government & foreign sector on all final goods & services produced in the country over a period of time, usually a year
- National Expenditure = C + I + G + (X-M)

## Back to National Income
- All 3 methods of arriving at the National Income Statistics of a country must yield the same result.
- National Income = National Output = National Expenditure
- The 3 terms can be used interchangeably.

### Recap (CFY)
The circular flow of income shows that in any given time period (say a year), the value of output produced in an economy is equal to the total income generated in producing that output, which is equal to the expenditures made to purchase that output.

## And back to Aggregate Expenditure
- Aggregate Expenditure (AE) is the total planned spending on final goods and services.
- The elements of aggregate expenditure can be expressed in the equation
$$AE=C + I + G + (X-M)$$
- Aggregate Expenditure (AE) is the total planned expenditure on final goods and services at a given price level by economic agents.
- There are 4 main economic agents (Sectors), households (C), firms (I), government (G) and the foreign sector (X-M)
$$\therefore AE = C + I+ G+ (X-M)$$
- The aggregate expenditure is the total expenditure in the economy, i.e. the expenditure (spending) of all the ‘players’ in the economy.
	- Households  
	- Firms  
	- Government  
	- Foreign sector

## Factors affecting AE

### Consumption Expenditure “C”
- ‘C’ is the purchase of domestically produced goods and services for the satisfaction of consumer wants.
- That part of national income (NY) that is spent on consumer goods
- Affected by
	1. Income (Disposable) Y
	2. Level of interest rates
	3. Accessibility of credit
	4. GovernmentPolicy
	5. Price Expectations
	6. Savings

### Investment Expenditure "I"
- Investments are expenditure on capital goods such as equipment, plants as well as additions to stocks of raw materials and intermediate goods.
- Most factors that affect investment are profit –related--- any change in Revenue and/or Cost
	1. Interest rates
	2. Business Expectations
	3. Government Policy
	4. Technological Change
	5. Infrastructure

## Government Expenditure "G"
- The amount of spending by the government and is independent of changes in National income in Short Run
- G as a component of AE does not include expenditure on transfer payments
- G1: Current expenditure which provides for day to day functions of government
- G2: Current expenditure to provide for future needs eg schools, roads, power, communications, dams, etc

## Net Exports (X-M)
- X is export revenue
- M is import expenditure
- Export revenue (X) refers to revenue received from the sale of goods and services to foreign countries.
- Import expenditure (M) refers to expenditure incurred due to purchases of goods and services from foreign countries.
- Export revenue (X) - An increase in export revenue will cause an increase in output and income.
	- X is influenced by the national income of the foreign country and is independent of the national income of the local economy.
- Import expenditure (M) - The national income of the home country is reduced when M increases as there are more financial leakages from the circular flow of income.
- Export revenue (X) involves the sale of goods and services to foreign countries.  
	- X influenced by changes in the foreign country National Income as well as exchange rates
- Import Expenditure (M) are purchases of goods and services from foreign countries.
	- M influenced by changes in the domestic country National Income as well as exchange rates
