## Income and Wealth; the difference
- Income and wealth are different concepts
- One represents a flow of funds (income)
- The other represents a stock of assets (wealth)
- They are closely linked; the more income a household has, the greater the capacity for building wealth over time

## Income
- Most households have more than one source of private income
	- Wages
	- Salaries
	- Investment
	- Pension
- **Gross income** is determined by adding any transfers a household receives from government e.g. pension
- Direct taxes are deducted to determine **disposable income**
- Gross income is before taxes, disposable income is after taxes
- Most households also receive some form of indirect benefit (social transfers) such as assistance with school fees or healthcare costs, which add to final income

### Purchasing Power of Individuals

#### Minimum Wage and Transfers
- Some peoples’ pay is influenced by minimum wages or awards rather than by free negotiations between employer and employee.
- In Australia, for example, the minimum wage is set by Fair Pay Australia and is altered from time to time.
- Eligible people may receive transfers from the government, for example as pensions or benefits if they are unemployed, are over pension age or have young families.

#### Income Tax
- Income, after an allowance for transfers, is known as Gross Income.
- Households pay income tax on their gross income.
- The income that remains after payment of direct tax is known as disposable income.
- The Australian income tax is progressive, meaning that people on higher incomes are taxed at a proportionately higher rate than people on low incomes.

#### Social Wage
- The final purchasing power or value of households' income is subject to two further adjustments.
- (First), the government provides a number of things at no or low cost to households, for example, government schooling, healthcare through Medicare, use of most roads, libraries and so on.
- The value of these products can be considered to be a form of social wage and in effect raises the purchasing power of peoples’ disposable incomes.

#### Indirect Tax
- (Second), the government also collects revenue from indirect taxes like GST and excise duty.
- These taxes are levied when people spend money or undertake certain activities.
- These indirect taxes reduce the purchasing power of disposable incomes.

## Wealth
- The current value of the assets a household has accumulated over time through savings; financial investments, business profits, inheritance
- The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) defines wealth as the difference between a household's assets (what you own) and its liabilities (what you owe)
	- If liabilities exceed assets, you are in debt
- Household assets are generally held as property, shares, savings and superannuation, while liabilities include mortgages, personal loans, and credit card debt

## The Lorenz Curve
- A Lorenz curve is used to show the degree of income inequality in an economy.
- Named after an American statistician, Conrad Lorenz, who devised this measure of income inequality in 1905, it is a visual representation of income distribution.
- The Curve shows the percentage of income received by different sections of the population.
- To construct a Lorenz curve, we draw a square box, as in the figure.
- Both axes show cumulative data, that is, totals that have been added together. For example, the level of income at 40% is the total share of income received by the lowest 40% of the population added together.
- A Lorenz curve, therefore, must start at the origin (no people = no income) and finish in the top right corner (all income must be received by someone)
- The vertical axis measures the total amount of income in an economy in cumulative percentages (therefore it runs from 0 to 100%)
- The horizontal axis plots the total population in the economy, also in cumulative percentages (therefore this, too, runs from 0 to 100%).
- (‘Cumulative’ means that 20 represents the poorest 20% of the population, 40 represents the poorest 40%, and so on.)

## Income Distribution
### The Lorenz Curve
- The population is ranked according to their income, from the lowest to the highest income.
- If everybody received the same income the Lorenz Curve would be a straight, diagonal line, running from the origin to the top right of the diagram.
- This is called the line of equality.
- The more the curve dips away from the line of equality the more uneven is the distribution of income.
- The diagonal line in the diagram represents perfect equality in income distribution, as it shows that if income were perfectly equally distributed, 20% of the population would received 20% of income, 40% would receive 40% of income, and so on.
- The Lorenz curve plots the actual relationship between percentages of the population and the shares of income they receive.
- The Gini coefficient is a measure that indicates the degree of curvature or concavity of the line.

### The Gini Coefficient
- The Gini coefficient (named after Corrado Gini, an Italian statistician) is a summary measure of the information contained in the Lorenz curve of an economy.
- It is expressed as:

- If there were perfect income equality, the coefficient would be zero, since the numerator of the ratio would be zero.
- The Gini coefficient is a summary measure of income inequality, and in a Lorenz diagram is the ratio of the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve, to the total area under the diagonal.
- It has a value between 0 and 1;
- The closer the value is to 0, the greater the income equality; the closer the value is to 1, the greater the income inequality.
- The closer it is to 1 (larger Gini), the greater is the income inequality, since the further away is the Lorenz curve from the diagonal.
- A perfectly unequal income distribution would be where a single household receives all the income of the economy, and the numerator would be equal to the entire area under the diagonal, making the Gini coefficient equal to 1.
