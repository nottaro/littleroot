- An economic situation when there is a sustained increase in the general price level
	- General price level: all prices, not the price of one good
	- Sustained increase: Continuous, not a one-time increase
- Inflation is defined as a persistent and appreciable rise in the general level of prices (noticeable price increases that occur over time, and across a range of goods)

## Measuring Inflation
- Inflation refers to the rate of change of the general price level (GPL).
- The inflation rate over a period of time is measured by the percentage rate of change using a given price index
- Rate of inflation is basically the rate of change
-  That is, $\frac{x_2 - x_1}{x_1} \times 100\%$
- Types of price indices
	- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
	- Retail Price Index (RPI)
	- Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
	- Producer Price Index (PPI)

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services
- It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods/services and averaging them
- The goods are weighted according to their importance
- Inflation refers to the rate of change of GPL
- The inflation rate between any two periods of time is measured by the percentage rate of change in the relevant price index

## Causes of Inflation

### Demand-Pull Inflation
- Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand (AD) rises at a rate that is not matched by the output of goods and services (Aggregate Supply)
- What causes an increase in AD leading to rightward shift of AD curve?
	- AD = C + I + G + (X – M)
	- Rise in consumption expenditure by households
	- Rise in firms’ investment expenditure
	- Rise in demand for country’s exports
	- Excessive speculative spending
	- Rise in government expenditure or decrease tax
	- Expansionary fiscal or monetary policy

### Cost-Pull Inflation
- Cost Push Inflation occurs when rising production costs (cost of production) are passed on to consumers who then pay higher prices for final goods and services.
- Costs reflect the prices paid for productive inputs.
- Periods of cost push inflation can be attributed to increases in prices of significant productive inputs. (for example, crude oil, wheat, labour, etc.)
- Wage Pull Inflation
	- Caused by persistent rise in wages without corresponding rise in labour productivity
- Import Price- Push Inflation
	- Caused by rising import prices resulting in rise in imported consumer goods & raw materials
- Profit Push Inflation
	- Caused by firms making use of their market power to make higher profits by raising prices
- Tax Push Inflation
	- Caused by increase in taxation
- Exhaustion of Natural Resources
	- Caused by depletion of major natural resources for example due to natural disasters

### In Summary

| Type of Inflation   | Demand-pull Inflation                                                  | Cost-pull Inflation                                                  |     |     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Causes of inflation | Caused by persistent increases in AD not matched by output of G&S (AS) | Caused by persistent rises in costs of production, independent of AD |     |     |

## Effects of inflation

### Loss of Confidence in Currency
- As GPL rises, purchasing power of money falls, ceteris paribus.
- Domestic currency will have lower purchasing power $\rightarrow$ undermine people’s confidence in the currency $\rightarrow$ less willing to hold money.
- Internal value of money falls $\rightarrow$ people will preserve wealth by buying assets or foreign currencies
- Domestic currency depreciates (due to lower demand) and assets further increase in price

### Redistribution of Income
- If GPL increases, purchasing power decreases
- Debtor
	- Real value of their debt falls.
	- Encourages borrowing
- Creditor
	- Real value of their loans fall when loans are repaid.
	- Discourages lending.
- Variable Income Earner
	- Income is linked to GPL.
	- As GPL rises, nominal income also rises. Real value of income remains constant
	- Better off
- Fixed Income Earner
	- As GPL rises, real value of their incomes falls
	- Worse off
- **Inflation erodes the purchasing power of savings**
- Inflation discourages savings as the real value of savings is eroded 
    - But those saving for specific purposes  (eg. for retirement or children’s education) will have to save more to compensate for the fall in real value of savings.
- Those who save in terms of real assets (eg. jewellery, real estate) gain as the value of these assets tend to rise with rising prices.
- In summary, those who save in cash are worse off, and those who save in assets are better off

### Effects on Production
- Mild Inflation: Input costs rise slower than product price
	- **Pros:** Stimulates production due to high expected returns leads to a rise in I which leads to an increase in employment & productive capacity, leading to a rise in Y
	- **Cons:** Prices increase, profits increase, thus complacency increases and efficiency deceases; thus there is no incentive to conduct R & D (research and development)
- Creeping / Hyperinflation: Input costs rise faster than product price
	- **Cons:** Businesses operate at a loss, leading to them closing down, and a decrease in production
	- **Pros:** Surviving firms forced to be more efficient in order to remain in business

### Effects on Investment
- Inflation can be unpredictable, 
- High inflation rates are often associated with uncertainty about the future. 
- This makes planning difficult, as it has an adverse effect on planned capital investments, that is, the cost of production could be significantly different than predicted. 
- This creates a negative effect on economic growth and productive capacity

### Effects on Government Finance
- During mild inflation, GPL rises, leading to an increase in incomes and profits, leading to a rise in tax receipts, leading to an increase in government revenue.
- If government revenue rise faster than government expenditure, leading to a budget surplus
- In the longer run, benefits cannot offset the cost of inflation on society and the economy.

## Is inflation necessarily bad?
- The effects of inflation can be good or bad. It ultimately depends on:
	- Anticipated vs Unanticipated inflation  
	- the rate of inflation: mild, creeping, hyperinflation • duration of inflation: short or prolonged
	- whether productivity or efficiency rises with an increase in price levels.
