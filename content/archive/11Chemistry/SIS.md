## Report
1.  Background Research
	1. Aim
2. Hypothesis
3. Variables
	1. Independent Variable
	2. Dependent Variable
	3. Controlled Variable
4. Equipment and chemicals
5. Diagram
6. Method

### Data Processing
- Graph
- Gradient = $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ = rate
 
### Conclusion
- Did results support hypothesis?

### Evaluation
- Validity: Nothing else affects results
- Reliability: repeat experiment
	- Literally just this
	- Excludes outliers
	- Calculate average
	- ~~Rhyme for Ms Pilling, help generations of students!~~
- Error
	- Something that affects results
	- Systematic error
		- E.g., inclusion of an unknown substance. 
		- If gas is produced, human reaction time cannot contain all of the gas
			- Use a gas syringe :D
	- Random error
		- human reaction time, **you underestimate my parry and dodge timing, ms pilling ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥**

## Discussion:
### Hazard
- Potential event that causes harm
- Also an object that causes harm
- E.g., dangerous substances
### Risk
- Occurrence of event that causes harm
- Also the likelihood of an event that causes harm
- E.g., effect of dangerous substances
#### Minimise Risk
- Things that prevent the occurrence of events that cause harm
- E.g., wear protective equipment
- If gas is produced, carry out experiment in well ventilated area
- prevent the risk or reduce the loss of control of the hazard
- reduce the effects

## Measurements
$$1 \ cm^3 = 1 \ mL$$
$$mol \ dm^{-3} = mol\ L^{-1}$$
