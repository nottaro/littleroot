- Colourless liquid hydrocarbon that is a cyclic compound and an aromatic
- Molecular formula of $C_6 H_6$
- A conjugated system is a system of connected p-orbitals
- Benzene is a planar molecule containing a ring of 6 carbon atoms, each with a hydrogen atom attached
- The 6 carbon atoms form a perfectly regular hexagon, and all carbon-carbon bonds have the same length
- Aromatics: Unsaturated hydrocarbons with ring/circle structure

###### Benzene has a conjugated system
1. These systems comprise of overlapping pi electron clouds
2. This allows for the delocalisation of pi electrons across all adjacent aligned p-orbitals, and thus the electrons do not belong to a single bond
3. There are exactly 6 (1 from each carbon atom) delocalised electrons above and below the plane of the ring. These electrons are delocalised within the benzene ring, and can move randomly

> [!info] Stability
> 
> The presence of the delocalised electrons makes benzene particularly stable, as benzene's conjugated pi electrons resonate freely within the cyclic ring, thus resulting in its 2 resonance forms of alternating single/double bonds. This resonance lowers the overall energy of the molecule, and thus makes it more stable

## Reactions
- Undergoes complete and incomplete combustion
- **No addition reactions**
- **Substitution: requires catalyst (UV light)**
	- The benzene can easily undergo substitution reactions, as this does not involve breaking the conjugated pi electron system and losing its stability
	- Here, energy in the form of UV light is required to break the bonds between Carbon and Hydrogen in Benzene and between atoms in the reacting compound
	- Now the atoms are in a high energy state and can then react with benzene, substituting the hydrogen attached

### Reactivity of Benzene
- Least reactive from alkanes, alkenes, cyclic compounds, and most other hydrocarbons
- This is because it is highly stable
- Benzene's conjugated pi electrons resonate freely within the cyclic ring, thus resulting in its 2 resonance forms of alternating single/double bonds. 
- This resonance lowers the overall energy of the molecule, and thus makes it more stable, and thus less reactive
