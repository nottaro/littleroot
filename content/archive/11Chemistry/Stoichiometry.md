- $x$ mols of a substance reacts with $x$ mols of another substance to create $x$ mols of a product
- If one reactant has more moles than another (i.e. is in excess, and some moles are not involved in the reaction), the reactant with the lowest number of moles is the **limiting reagent**, and thus only that amount of moles will react
- For example: $$kX + mY → nZ$$
- $k$ moles of $X$ will react with $m$ moles of $Y$ to produce $n$ moles of $Z$
- Here, if the number of moles of $X$ exceeds $k$, only $k$ moles will react, and $mY$ would be the limiting reagent (assuming $m$ is constant)

## Moles (not gas)

$$n = \frac{m}{M}$$
- $n=$  number of moles
- $m =$ mass (g)
- $M =$ Molar Mass (g per mol)
- Note: this is only for solids, aqueous solutions, and liquids

## Moles for Ideal Gases
$$n=\frac{V}{22.71}$$
- $n=$ number of moles
- $V =$ volume (L)
- This is for standard temperature and pressure ($0˚C=273.15\ K$, $100\ kPa$)
- **Always assume standard conditions, unless stated otherwise**

$$PV=nRT$$
- $n=$ number of moles
- $P=$ pressure (kPa)
- $V=$ volume (L)
- $T =$ temperature (k)
- $R =$ universal gas constant, $8.314 \ J\ K^{-1} \ mol^{-1}$
