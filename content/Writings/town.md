We're all trying to survive, right?

Welp. Unfortunately, due to a few wolves (teachers), natural disasters (exams/tests), and the desert itself, it's just a *teensy itty bitty* difficult. I lied. It's horrible.

I sell books, and am a tour guide in my spare time. Apparently I write newspapers now.
