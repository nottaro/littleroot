title: Perth Pokémon Oceania Regionals 2023
---

So...as a hobby, I play a funny little game called Pokémon. Not just the story mode, but also the competitive mode, also known as VGC, or Video Game Competition formats. I played on [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), but this year, I had the chance to attend a physical, official event known as the Perth Regionals.

This event was spread out over 2 days, the 3rd and 4th of March. Players would compete in 7 rounds, and the top 8 would move onto the 2nd day. 3 points were allocated for a win, and 0 points were added for a loss, with 1 point being added for draws. The 8 players with the highest amount of points would move on to the next day. Your ranking was also determined by the opponents you faced. For example, someone who beat the top player but only had 1 win would be ranked higher than someone who beat the bottom player with 1 win.

This was in the Series 2 format, which allowed Paradox Pokémon, and the regional Paldea Dex, apart from the Ruins. If you have no idea what it is, just search it up.

I had a lot of trouble making/finding a team to use, as I hadn't finished the game yet, and I didn't get much time to play. My friends Kat and Preston were kind enough to build the team for me, so all I had to do was find a team. I ended up settling on this team here, which was covered by CybertronVGC in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvyGNSWsdPU).

I managed to squeeze in a bit of practice on Showdown, but only managed to get a few games off in the in-game ladder.
