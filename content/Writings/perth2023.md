title: Perth Pokémon Oceania Regionals 2023
---

So...as a hobby, I play a funny little game called Pokémon. Not just the story mode, but also the competitive mode, also known as VGC, or Video Game Competition formats. I played on [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), but recently this year, I had the chance to attend a physical, official event known as the Perth Regionals.

This event was spread out over 2 days, the 3rd and 4th of March. Players would compete in 7 rounds, and the top 8 would move onto the 2nd day.
