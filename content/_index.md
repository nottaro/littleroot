> Little Timmy loves playing the new Pocket Monsters game his mommy got him for Christmas. It hasn’t been two weeks, but little Timmy’s already beaten the game using the totally awesome Charizard he got from Professor Oak. Little Timmy thinks he’s hot stuff. Little Timmy is a spoiled brat because his pushover parents let him play video games for ten hours a day. 
> 
> And little Timmy is brimming with the naive confidence of an infant sloshing around in a loaded diaper.  Smug little Timmy invites his only friend, Next Door Kyle, over to battle. His sweaty hands can barely plug in his link cable, he’s so eager to show off his Charizard. It knows Fire Spin, Flamethrower, AND Fire Blast.

> “Daaaamn, Timwad,” says Kyle moments later through a mouthful of Gushers and Pepsi Blue, having 6-0’ed Timmy’s entire team with a single Golduck. “You’re so bad at this game. I bet you don’t even know what Rhyhorn evolves into.”

## Hello!

Welcome to Littleroot v2!

This version uses Quartz 4 to run. Unfortunately, a ton of my themes and callouts were destroyed, so I'm working on rebuilding it. Until then, enjoy this theme I call Cerulean!

Edit: I have no idea how to add custom CSS.

Hope you enjoy the site! I'm [nottaro](WritingsDocs/AboutMe.md)! This is a website I made as a side project! Thanks to [nottacoz](https://github.com/nottacoz) and [EddieTheEd](https://github.com/eddietheed) for helping! 

You're quite welcome, Baju's. 👍

I'm a proud member of ✨[the town](WritingsDocs/town.md)✨. ~~I have broken away from the town, along with Ed.~~ I have come back to my senses. We should have a town page coming.....Osacr is making it. These are my [sister sites](townsites.md). 

why is this not syncing 😭

Originally my notes were on paper, but I'm working on copying them over! This is why my Methods ~~and Specialist~~ notes aren't complete...
- Update 5/4/2023: I've finished my Spec notes

I don't claim to have every single bit of information on these subjects, but I hope it's enough :)

These notes are on Obsidian, and run using [jzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)'s Quartz, with Github Pages. You can also ask me on Discord for them.

If you need help, contact me!

> [!success] Yellowstone National Park
> 
> The entirety of Yellowstone National Park is under the legal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, including a small part of the park that is actually in Idaho. According to US law, the jury for a trial has to come from the state and district in which the crime took place. However, since this small bit of Idaho has no people living in it, and is also part of a separate court district from the rest of the state, hypothetically the court would be unable to assemble a jury and thus unable to convict you.

~~Why do these notes take so long to sync.~~ It's because I added colons to my titles. Obsidian is racist.
