Hi! I'm Jonathan! This is a website I made as a side project! Thanks to Thomas Han and Edward Huynh for helping! 

Originally my notes were on paper, but I'm working on copying them over! This is why my Methods and Specialist notes aren't complete...

These notes are on Obsidian! You can also ask me on Discord for them!

Subjects:
1. [Chemistry](Chemistry/Chemistry.md)
2. [Physics](Physics/Physics.md)
3. [Economics](Economics/Economics.md)
4. [Literature](Literature/Literature.md)
5. [Methods](Methods/Methods.md)
6. [Specialist](Specialist/Specialist.md)

I'm 6'10", in case you were wondering. Also I have a 530 000 IQ mental CPU.
