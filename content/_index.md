I'm a proud member of [the town](Info/town.md). We should have a town page coming.....Osacr is making it. These are my [sister sites](Info/townsites.md).

Originally my notes were on paper, but I'm working on copying them over! This is why my Methods and Specialist notes aren't complete...

These notes are on Obsidian, and run using [jzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)'s Quartz, with Github Pages. You can also ask me on Discord for them.

```
The year is 1997. Little Timmy loves playing the new Pocket Monsters game his mommy got him for Christmas. It hasn’t been two weeks, but little Timmy’s already beaten the game using the totally awesome Charizard he got from Professor Oak. Little Timmy thinks he’s hot shit. Little Timmy is a spoiled brat because his pushover parents let him play video games for ten hours a day. And little Timmy is brimming with the naive confidence of an infant sloshing around in a loaded diaper.  
  
Smug little Timmy invites his only friend, Next Door Kyle, over to battle. His sweaty hands can barely plug in his link cable, he’s so eager to show off his Charizard. It knows Fire Spin, Flamethrower, AND Fire Blast.  
  
“Daaaamn, Timwad,” says Kyle moments later through a mouthful of Gushers and Pepsi Blue, having 6-0’ed Timmy’s entire team with a single Golduck. “You’re so bad at this game. I bet you don’t even know what Rhyhorn evolves into.”  
  
“Of course I do!” little Timmy whines. “It’s Rhydon—”  
  
And Next Door Kyle bellows a response that would echo through time.

~~Why do these notes take so long to sync.~~ It's because I added colons to my titles. Obsidian is racist.
