Heya! I'm [supaqwerty](https://github.com/supaqwerty)! This is a website I made as a side project! Thanks to [tacoz](https://github.com/nottacoz) and [EddieTheEd](https://github.com/eddietheed) for helping! 

I'm a proud member of [the town](Info/town.md). We should have a town page coming.....Osacr is making it. These are my [sister sites](Info/townsites.md).

Originally my notes were on paper, but I'm working on copying them over! This is why my Methods and Specialist notes aren't complete...

These notes are on Obsidian, and run using [jzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)'s Quartz, with Github Pages. You can also ask me on Discord for them.

Subjects:
1. [Chemistry](Subjects/Chemistry.md)
2. [Physics](Subjects/Physics.md)
3. [Economics](Subjects/Economics.md)
4. [Literature](Subjects/Literature.md)
5. [Methods](Subjects/Methods.md)
6. [Specialist](Subjects/Specialist.md)

I'm 6'10", in case you were wondering. Also I have a 530 000 IQ mental CPU.

~~Why do these notes take so long to sync.~~ It's because I added colons to my titles. Obsidian is racist.
