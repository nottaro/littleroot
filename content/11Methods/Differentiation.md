### Average Gradient
- Take 2 points $x_1, y_1$ and $x_2, y_2$
- The gradient is rise/run, or:

$$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

## Calculus
- What about the gradient at a specific point?
- This is where calculus comes in
- Calculus is the study of the rate that a change is happening (remember, rate of change is the same as gradient)
