## Position Vectors
Picture an object currently at point **A**, with a position vector _a_, and then moves along a path from point **A** to **R**, such that it moves with a velocity _v_

After a period of time *t*, the object would have moved *vt* units.  Thus, by the time it reaches point **R**, the position vector *r* would be given by $r = a+vt$
