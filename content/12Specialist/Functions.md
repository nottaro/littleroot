### Composite Functions

- Functions must have 1 element from the domain that assigns to one and only one element from the range
- i.e. one x value is associated with only one y value
- A composite function is when one function is processed by another. The notation for composite functions looks like the following

$$\text{The composition of g with f is } g(f(x)) \text{ or } g \circ f$$

- For $g(f(x))$ to exist, the range of $f(x)$ must be within the domain of $g(x)$
	- i.e.  for $x$ in the domain of $g(x)$, $f(x)$ must exist

### Inverse Functions

If we have a function, $f(x)$ that solves for values of $y$, it is possible for an inverse function, $f^{-1}(x)$, to exist **such that the inverse function solves for values of $x$ in the original function $f(x)$**. However, there are requirements that need to be met for an inverse function to exist

1. **One to one** (for both $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$): One element from the domain outputs one element in the range
2. $f^-1(x)$ exists naturally for a **one to one** function $f(x)$

The inverse of a function is its reflection over the line $y=x$
The domain of x is now the range of y
The range of y is now the domain of x
##### Where it doesn't exist
 **Many to one**: More than one element from the domain outputs one element in the range. **One to many**: Thus, for the inverse of $f(x)$, for every $x$ value, $f^{-1}(x)$ outputs more than one element in the range

##### How to find the inverse of a function
$$\text{We have a function } f(x)=2x+5 $$
$$\text{If } y = f(x)$$
$$\text{The inverse is } x=2y+5$$
$$\frac{{x-5}}{2}=y = f^{-1}(x)$$
1. Swap $y$ and $x$
2. Isolate $y$
3. Done!!!!!

### Absolute Functions
- for a functions $y= | x|$, all y values are positive

#### To graph $y=|f(x)|$
1. Retain the part of the graph above the x-axis
2. Reflect the part of the graph with negative y values above the x-axis

#### To graph $y=f(|x|)$
- Retain the part on the RHS of the y axis
- Reflect these points over the y-axis, but keep the RHS points

### Solving Absolute Functions
Say we have an equation $$|x-a| + |x-b|$$
How would we solve this?

## Rational Functions
- Horizontal asymptote is 

$$\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$
