In reference to [Edward's article](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/04-03-2023-The-town-analogy/)

Welcome! I'm a new addition to the town, but it's my pleasure to introduce you to our humble abode.

The desert (school) is harsh and unforgiving. You make one wrong move, one wrong step, and you get slammed to the ground. Blasts of wind (tests) and mighty sandstorms (exams) have discouraged many from settling here. 

But here we stand. Beaten down, weary, but still developing and steadily fighting back against the barren wastelands.

You might be wondering how this all started. Well, it started with 2 old friends.

Edward and Christian came along this desert, this empty land, and saw something. Where others saw a barren wasteland (school), death (dropping out), they saw life. They saw a garden. A mint-fresh garden, if you will. They saw safety from the sandstorms, the wind, and the wolves (teachers).

So they started the town. They built their houses. Over there, behind the orchards. Christian started a store. Right down there, behind the post office there. I still walk in and buy a coffee or two, every day.

But there's a legend. That there were 4 founders. 2 of them haven't been seen in a while. Those 2 were Mace and Osacr. Rumour says that they're dead(given up), or moved out of time (focused on academics). Nobody knows. Their houses are locked, and Edward and Christian will not commit breaking and entering. I'm not that law-abiding, though...

A few days ago, they've had a lot of luck. Their (jzhao's, we all stole from jzhao's) houses attracted an old friend of mine, Thomas, who decided that the desert wasn't for him. We can see his treehouse over there....the jacaranda tree, on that hill over there.  He's a brilliant architect (coder), and has expanded his house.

Unfortunately...not all of our town additions are good. Someone known as the "reaper" (I'm 99% sure only he calls himself that). He's kinda nosy...but he's a good person at heart. I'm sure that he'll be a good asset....eventually.

This is where I come in. I asked Edward, an old friend, to help me move into the town. Surprised, but gratified, he helped me build my house, and I built my walls in time for the oncoming sandstorm. That's it. Over there. Next to the treehouse

A new individual arrived. I haven't met her. She seems nice. She said that her Gothic-themed house (wix site) wasn't practical in the long run, so she decided to settle here. Her house is around there, near Edward's.

I'm 99% sure she was ~~coerced~~ invited by Edward.

Right now, I'm working as a tourist guide. I invite people to the town and show them around. I also have a little shop, a bookstore. 

**You might have heard that my house is not fully built. It is. I'm just building more.**

There's also a rumour going around that we are discriminatory, that we refuse refuge to those with ideas of Gothic-themed houses (wix websites). **This is absolutely true.** They are not allowed here. The idea may be revisited. Probably not. I despise them. I hate Gothic literature. Stupid Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

Another one of my friends started to settle in. His name is Dasindu. I sneaked a look at his financial records. Apparently he's 3 trillion in debt to some foreign company. I think they own his house as well. He lives on the outskirts of the town. I visit him sometimes. He's cool.

According to Edward, Dasindu is planning to relocate to a better house. He's been talking about it quite a lot recently, and has been talking to Christian about it. I hear that Christian is actually building it for him. I'll take a look at it tonight.

Well, that's everyone, as of now. Let's talk about something else.

Edward and Christian built this town to be a place of safety. Of tranquility. Of refuge, for travellers in the desert. For the nomads (non-website people). But off in the distance, there are some nomads who've discovered an oasis. They are thriving and relaxed, like us, but without a town, so to speak(elite students). How do they do that? They guard their secrets jealously, but that won't stop me... :)

There's a city, off in the distance, to the north. The legend, Jzhao, is there. He's designed most of the architecture here, so naturally, he's our god. 

The town is structured as follows; the 4 founders live in the old side of town, over there, while us new settlers (me, Thomas, reaper, etc) live in the new side of town. Dasindu lives in the old side as well (somehow), just further back than the others

All citizens of the town offer a variety of goods and services for your browsing. Stay as long as you like! It's all free....I think....

There's a lot of room in the new side of town. We have so many vacant plots here. Please, if you want a place to stay away from the desert, we will welcome you with open arms. I'll help you set up your house (as long as it's not Gothic-themed). I'm just a block or two away. Edward and Christian help out occasionally too.

Perhaps one day, we'll be like the nomads. Free, and one with the ravaging desert.

Like the Skywalkers.

From Star Wars.

Yes, including Rey.

I actually kinda liked the new trilogy.

*With love(unless you have a Gothic-themed house)
