Hi! I'm nottaro. I made this website as a side project.

These are just some notes for some Subjects. My subjects are listed on my home page.

I make notes and publish them here. I might not have every single bit of content covered, but I do try.

I have perfect pitch, apparently...

My sister sites are [here](townsites.md).

If you want to contact me, just comment on my Github page.

I have a few hobbies, including, but not limited to:
- Playing volleyball
- Reading in general
- Competitive Pok√©mon
- Gaming in general
- Playing guitar

This is what I look like:

Hope you enjoy the site!
