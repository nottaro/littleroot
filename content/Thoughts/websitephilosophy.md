### Plagiarism
I don't like people who mooch off others' work. Please don't come here, copy my stuff, and pass it off as your own. It's just ethically wrong, and you're just a jerk if you do that.

No, my notes aren't NFTs.

### Copyright
Cite me, and we'll be fine.
### Mooching
As I said, please don't mooch over this. People who take and don't give are equally as bad. Please, just leave a good review on my github page, or send me some of your notes!

With love,
