## Literary Theories

### Structuralism
- Predominantly concerned with perceptions and description of structures
- Claims nature of element in any given situation has no significiance by itself, and is in fact determined by all the other elemetns involved in the situation
- the full significance of any entity cannot be perceived unless and until it is integrated into the structure of which it forms a part (Hawkes, p. 11.)
- Semiotics is the science of signs
- Semiology proposes that a great diversity of our human action and productions all convey "shared" meanings to members of a particular culture, and so can be analysed as signs which function in diverse kinds of signifying systems
- Key terms
	- Binary opposition
	- Mythemes
	- Sign vs symbol

- tldr:
	- Strucutralsim is a way of understanding culture and meaning in the arts by relating the individual piece of art to something larger
	- Comes from a branch of flanguage study called strcutural linguistics
	- Structuralism is explciiclty anti-individual
	- About a shared structure of meaning
