### Definition
Compact Oxford English Dictionary: "a style and concept in the arts characterised by distrust of theories and ideologies and by the drawing of attention to conventions"

American Heritage Dictionary: "of or relating to art, architecture that reacts against earlier modernist prinicples, as by reintroducing traditional or classical elements of style or by charrying modernist styles or practices to extremes: 'It \[a roadhouse] is so architecturally interesting...with its postmodern wooden booths and sculptural clock'"

## Postmodern Literature
Post modern literature, like postmodernism as a whole, tends to resist definition or classification as a "movement", i.e. difficult to define/describe as a movement

### Characteristics
- Intertextuality
	- A text is not constructed in isolation
		- Variants of this quote are often found in exam questions
	- Each text is influenced by those that preceded it
	- Texts may allude to or echo other texts
	- Key difference between allusion is that allusion stems from the author, intertextuality stems from the reader
- Metafiction
	- This is writing about writing OR foregrounding the process OR breaking the fourth wall
- Pastiche
	- Like a collage or Frankenstein's monster (or that terrible Deadpool wannabe in the Wolverine movie)...this is the collation of elements from a variety of sources/genres
- Maximalism and minimalism
	- Minimalism is low key, cutting things down to their essential elements
		- it is like the iPhone camera
	- Maximalism is elaborate descriptions of extreme detail
		- it is like the Samsung camera
- Playfulness and black humour
	- Postmodern literature is often tongue-in-cheek and will make light of dark situations and/or use irony in its storytelling
- Fragmentation
	- Who needs linear narratives when you can mess with your audience by destroying the space-time continuum?
	- Basically the narrative is not linear, i.e. in fragments
	- It's like an iPhone when it drops from a height of 1 mm. It is shattered.
- Magic Realism
- Technoculture and hyperreality
- Paranoia
	- The feeling that someone is watching you, or someone is out to get you
		- SOMEONE IS OUT TO GET ME, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- Temporal distortion

> [!quote] "No British woman this century can come close to her achievements in grasping power. Someone of the wrong sex and the wrong class broke through what looked like invincible barriers to reach into the heart of the establishment. Women who complain that Margaret Thatcher was not a feminist because she didn't help other women or openly acknowledge her debt to feminism have a point, but they are also missing something vital. She normalised female success. She showed that although female power and masculine power may have different languages, different metaphors, different gestures, different traditions, different ways of being glamorous or nasty they are equally strong, equally valid...No-one can ever question whether women are capable of single-minded vigour, of efficient leadership, after Margaret Thatcher. She is the great unsung heroine of British feminism."

> [!quote] "Well, she wasn't a feminist, nor will she ever be a "feminist icon" in my sense of the word. But we can't deny that having our first woman prime minister was a major symbolic leap forward. And it's salutary for those on the left to be reminded that positive social change does sometimes come from the right"

>[!quote] "Margaret Thatcher became leader of the Conservative party at the height of the women's movement, yet she was completely apart from our campaigns, our passions and our identity. She was the middle-aged woman with the hats, the pearls, the teeth, the strangled high-pitched voice, and the policies which had nothing to do with equal pay for work of equal value, free abortion on demand or take back the night marches."

### Second Wave Feminism
- The key fight of the first wave of feminism across the world was that of the right of women to vote
- The second wave of feminism brought forward questions around gender, gender-based discrimination, equality, and the role of women in society, politics, the home and the workforce
- Feminists associated with the second wave challenged traditional perceptions pertaining to 'taboo' topics such as: women's sexual agency outside of marriage, monogamy, heteronormativity; the legality of abortion; the availability of contraception
- The movement was also sought to raise awareness of issues such as domestic violence, rape (and marital rape), and sexual harassment
