# Journaling in the Arts

## What is journaling?
- A journal is a written record of incidents, experiences, and ideas
- Also known as a personal journey, notebook,  diary and log
- Writers often keep journals to record observations and explore ideas that may eventually be developed into more formal essays, articles, and stories
- In the arts at tertiary level, journaling is an ongoing independent document that a student will build over a year, to represent their skills, creativity, passion, and engagement

### What is journaling in literature at Mod?
- A literature journal will reflect academic and theoretical engagement with texts and a compilation of personal writing, both in fiction and non-fiction
- In short, a year-long journal will demonstrate a literature student's qualities
- Their passion for language and literature, the maturity addressing theoretical topics, their creativity exploring form and feeling and their scholarly skill consolidating information over an extended period of time
- (yes this is marked, 11% of your grade)

### Your Literature Journal for 2024
- In-class note-taking
- Frameworks with new vocabulary lists, concept definitions and technical terminology
- Your personal insights, ideas, understandings and responses to texts that you have been studying
- Compile research with sited works and contextual information
- Planning and drafting for assessments
- Diagrams and mind-maps
- Timed writing exercises
- Quote banks

### "Easy" marks
- Your journal is a compilation of your efforts throughout the year
- It is a portfolio of your studies and, as such, will be the most important tool in your revision processes
- Took notes in class? Put it in your journal
- Planned an essay? Put it in your journal
- Completed a practice close reading? Put it in your journal
- Done stuff? Put it in your journal

## How should the journal look
- Your journal will reflect *your* engagement with topics we discuss in class, the texts we engage with, and authors we get to know
- Thus, each journal will be different
- The most effective journals will use labelling, colour-coding, and other organisational tools to make it more effective as a revision/studying tool


> insert a bunch of pictures of journals (like, actual workbooks with images and tabs and stuff)


## What doesn't go in your journal?
- This is **your** journal.
- Put in it what you feel will make it something *you* want to come back to and revisit
- BUT!
- Your teachers don't want to see:
	- Handouts/printouts that have not been highlighted/annotated
	- Copies of your assessments without reflections or rewrites
	- Overly personal comments/information
