## What is a 'lens'?
- A reading lens can be thought of as a critical framework through which your interpretation of a text is informed
- Applying a lens involves synthesising relevant theory with your interpretation of a particular text - to this extent, you are required to do some reading and research (it is very clear to marker if you are knowledgeable or not)
- At its most basic level, presenting a reading using a lens could read something along the lines of:
	- "Through the use of a feminist lens, the TEXT can be interpreted as"
	- "When read through a feminist lens"
	- "A feminist reading of the text..."
- Remember - it is crucial that you discuss relevant theory in your response (define/explain the characteristics, contextualise, draw on specific theories, etc) - this can be done in the introduction or first body paragraph, working to frame your response and demonstrate to the marker that you are indeed knowledgeable

## Feminism - The Basics
- Inequality between men and women is universal and the most significant form of inequality
- Gender norms are socially constructed not determined by biology and can thus be changed
- Patriarchy is the main cause of gender inequality - women are subordinate because men have more power
- Feminism is a political movement; it exists to rectify sexual inequalities, although strategies for social change vary enormously
- There are 4 types of feminism - Radical, Marxist, Liberal and Difference/Postmodern

### Typical Questions to ask
- Interrogate texts, considering the following
	- How is the relationship between men and women portrayed?
	- What are the power relationships between men and women (or characters assuming male/female roles)?
	- How are male and female roles defined?
	- What constitutes masculinity and femininity?
	- How do characters embody these traits?
	- Do characters take on traits from opposite genders? How so? How does this change others' reactions to them?
	- What does the work reveal about the operations (economically, politically, socially or psychologically) of patriarchy?
	- What does the work imply about the possibilities of sisterhood as a mode of resisting patriarchy?
	- What does the work say about women's creativity?
	- What does the history of the work's reception by the public and by the critics tell us about the operation of patriarchy?
	- What role does the work play in terms of women's literary history and literary tradition?
