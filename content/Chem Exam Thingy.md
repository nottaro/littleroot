**Suitable primary standards**
- lists 3 properties of primary standard
- doesn't actually have to say that NaOH doesn't have it, bc you're alr stating it when u state that Na2CO3 has it

**Complete the table using the readings from the burette**
- Find difference in values
- Only uses 3 values??? apparently????
	- maybe it was because there was an error

**Ocean acidification thingy**
- Less mass of shells due to higher pH as there is a lower rate of calcification

**Hydrolysis**
- Compare \[OH] and \[H3O+] to justify if acidic or basic
- When salt is comprised of acid/base with similar strength, state that effect sizes are roughly equal

**Difference between Dry cell and Alkaline cell**
- 2 marks for each correct point
- Electrode material
- Electrolyte
- Anode half cell equations

**Electrorefining of copper: determine if zinc or silver can be extracted**
- Describe electrorefining of copper
- Generic link to zinc + silver
- Show that silver will fall to bottom as anodic sludge
	- State that it is because it has a lower oxidation potential and thus is less likely to oxidise
- Show that zinc will oxidise and float around in solution
	- State that it is because it has a higher oxidation potential and is thus less likely to reduce
- **Silver can be filtered out, zinc cannot be separated**

**Know difference between risk and hazard**

**Energy profile diagram**
- Separate enthalpy change and activation energy for clarity

**Never say amount, always say volume/mass**

**Buffer solution**
- State that buffer is formed
- Buffer equation
- Le Chatelier's Principle for small changes in pH when strong acid/base is added
- State that when base is added, formation of reactants is favoured

**Redox**
- Chlorides are not appropriate half cells
- Do not mention pressure if dealing with solely solutions and electrodes of the material
