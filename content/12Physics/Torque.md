Translational equilibrium: $$\Sigma F = 0$$

Rotational equilibrium: 
$$\Sigma \tau=0$$
### Torque equation
$$F_{\tau} = \text{F r }\sin \theta$$
- F = applied force (N)
- $\tau$ = newtons meters $\text{ N m}$
- r = length of lever (m)
	- distance between point of orientation
	- forced axis of rotation
- $\theta$ = angle between F and r

**For a given applied force, torque will be maximised by applying at the greatest distance from the axis of rotation**

**For a given distance from an axis of rotation, torque will be maximised by applying the largest force possible**

**For any given combination of F and r, torque will be maximised by having them at right angles**
