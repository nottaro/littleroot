- Electric field: region of space around an object that has the property of charge in which another object that also has charge experiences a repulsive or attractive force, that extends to infinity, and weakens over time, as per the inverse square law
- 2 types of charge
	- Positive 
	- Negative
- 3 states of charge
	- Positive
	- Negative
	- Neutral
- Some particles have only 1 state of charge
	- Protons are always positive
	- Neutrons/neutrinos are always neutral
	- Quarks are always charged
	- Electrons are always negative
- Neutral objects are made of negative and positive components

#### Electric field diagrams
- Charge is assumed to be uniform
- Uniform distribution
- **MUST KNOW**

##### Field line rules
1. They're arrows, not lines
2. For point charges, field density is uniform, thus lines must be evenly distributed around surface
3. Field lines start/end at the surface
4. Field lines should start/finish perpendicular to surface
5. Number of field lines indicates field density
6. Minimum of 4 lines recommended (not **required**)
7. Direction of field lines are determined by hypothetical test charge
8. Field lines cannot touch or cross

$$F_{{\epsilon}}= \frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}= \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} } \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}$$

- Electronic constant for a vacuum or air = $\epsilon_{0} = 8.85*10^{-12} \text{ F m}^{-1}$  


$$E = \frac{F}{q} \text{ N C}^{-1}$$

$$E = \frac{\Delta V}{d} \text{ V m}^{-1}$$

$$\Delta E=Fd=Vq$$
