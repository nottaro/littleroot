First practical: STAW Experiment 4.1: **Going around in Circles**
- Not marked
- BUT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
- VERY IMPORTANT 

### Some SIS stuff
Accuracy: how close your results are to the "true" value. Relies on scale/error bar
Precision: Fineness of equipment, how close your results are to each other
Reliability: If you do more trials and results are basically the same
Validity: does independent variable directly affect dependent variable, are there any other variables, known or unknown, that are impacting the results

# Horizontal Circular Motion
- **Newton's First Law:** Any object in constant/uniform motion (speed/direction is not changing, thus velocity is not changing) will continue in that motion unless acted upon by an external/unbalanced force, and will continue to do this forever.
- **Horizontal circular motion requires an unbalanced for acting**
- Thus, for a projectile, the **real** force is gravity
- **Centripetal Force:** any force that causes an object to move continuously in a circle
	- Often a net force
	- "Centre" + "Seeking"
	- Has to be supplied by some other **real** force
	- Not a real force on its own
	- Towards the centre of circular motion
- No such thing as a **centrifugal** force

### Real Forces
- Gravity
- Friction
	- Sideways friction, e.g. between car tyres and road
- Tension (tethered object)
	- Away from the object that is tethered towards the centre of circular motion
- Normal force
	- The action the car door furthest from turning circle on passenger
- Electric/Magnetic


### Formula
$$v = \frac{C}{T}=\frac{2 \pi r}{T}=2\pi rf$$


- T is period
- f is frequency

$$a_{c} = \frac{v^2}{r}= \frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$

> [!important] many contexts about direction, not always compass directions

## Banked Corners
>[!quote] why are you late? (student answers) don't care! don't be late! - Dr Ormande Waters

$$F_{c}=F_{n} \sin \theta= \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
$$F_{n} \cos \theta=mg$$
$$\tan \theta=\frac{v^2}{rg}$$

## Vertical Circular Motion
- Not necessarily uniform speed
- Also used for speed bumps
- At the top of the circle, tension is the least

$$F_{T}=F_{c}-F_{g}= \frac{mv^2}{r}-mg$$
- At the bottom, tension force is max
- At the sides:

$$F_{t}=F_{c}+F_{g}=\frac{mv^2}{r}+mg$$
