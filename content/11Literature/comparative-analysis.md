## Writing on 2 or more texts

### How to structure an answer - patterns
- Look for patterns andd group poems, ideas, and use of conventions andd techniques
- **HOW** patterns
	- Symbols
	- Motifs
	- Imagery
	- Hybrid phrasing
	- Structure
	- Pacing
- **WHAT** patterns
	- Representations
	- Ideas about cultural identity
	- Nation identity
	- Australian History
	- Attitudes
	- Values
- Draft a thesis and topic sentences that outline those patterns
- **ONE** pattern per paragraph: HOW + WHAT
- Either choose 3 HOW(techniques/poetic devices) patterns and identify the ideas they construct
- Or choose 3 WHAT(ideas) patterns and identify the techniques that construct them

### Tracing patterns across 2 poems
- Cheap white goods
- Dingo lounge
- **Patterns:**
	- HOW - symbols of western market culture, industrial culture, symbols of indigenous culture
		- Imagery
		- Tone
			- Sardonic, bitter, critical
	- WHAT - devaluing of indigenous culture, commodification of indigenous culture (Western Capitalist values - making money), death of indigenous culture, domination by mainstream Western culture (dismissive attitude towards indigenous culture)

## Poems/Meanings

### **jaded olympic moments**
- **title**: stating how the aboriginal dance at the 2012 Brisbane Olympics was nothing more than a publicity stunt, that it was "jaded" (false)
- highlighting how much land is worth to indigenous australians
- potentially criticises colonial ideas by illustrating the negative effects of colonialism
- highlights separation of race/colour
	- "itâ€™s still very much an US and THEM kind of deal in this modern dreaming"
- also highlights the different cultural values between colonists and aboriginals
- how disadvantaged aboriginals are
	- "we're city people without a language and some of us have even less"

### **cheap white-goods at the dreamtime sale**: 
- **title**: ironic, sarcastic, sardonic, stating the devaluation of indigenous culture, likening them to cheap white goods
- highlights how little aboriginal culture is valued
- how their culture is like a theme park attraction, i.e. people are interested in it, but don't actually want to engage
- compares their culture to "cheap white-goods"
	- perhaps implies that their culture is worth as much as a knock-off brand, or represents that their culture is a knock-off of others, e.g. other religion such as christianity
- sacred sites, e.g. uluru, are not treated with the same amount of respect as other monuments are 
- furthermore, sacred monuments are not viewed as such by european/american society
