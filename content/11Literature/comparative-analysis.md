## Writing on 2 or more texts
###### preparing for an essay on the poetry of Samuel Wagan Watson

### How to structure an answer - patterns
- Look for patterns andd group poems, ideas, and use of conventions andd techniques
- **HOW** patterns
	- Symbols
	- Motifs
	- Imagery
	- Hybrid phrasing
	- Structure
	- Pacing
- **WHAT** patterns
	- Representations
	- Ideas about cultural identity
	- Nation identity
	- Australian History
	- Attitudes
	- Values
- Draft a thesis and topic sentences that outline those patterns
- **ONE** pattern per paragraph: HOW + WHAT
- Either choose 3 HOW(techniques/poetic devices) patterns and identify the ideas they construct
- Or choose 3 WHAT(ideas) patterns and identify the techniques that construct them

### Tracing patterns across 2 poems
- Cheap white goods
- Dingo lounge
- **Patterns:**
	- HOW - symbols of western market culture, industrial culture, symbols of indigenous culture
		- Imagery
		- Tone
			- Sardonic, bitter, critical
	- WHAT - devaluing of indigenous culture, commodification of indigenous culture (Western Capitalist values - making money), death of indigenous culture, domination by mainstream Western culture (dismissive attitude towards indigenous culture)

## Poems/Meanings
- **jaded olympic moments**
	- highlighting how much land is worth to indigenous australians
	- potentially criticises colonial ideas by illustrating the negative effects of colonialism
	- highlights separation of race/colour
		- "itâ€™s still very much an US and THEM kind of deal in this modern dreaming"
	- also highlights the different cultural values between colonists and aboriginals
	- how disadvantaged aboriginals are
		- "we're city people without a language and some of us have even less"
- **cheap white-goods at the dreamtime sale**
	- highlights how little aboriginal culture is valued
	- how their culture is like a theme park attraction, i.e. people are interested in it, but don't actually want to engage
	- compares their culture to "cheap white-goods"
		- perhaps implies that their culture is worth as much as a knock-off brand, or represents that their culture is a knock-off of others, e.g. other religion such as christianity
	- sacred sites, e.g. uluru, are not treated with the same amount of respect as other monuments are 
	- furthermore, sacred monuments are not viewed as such by european/american society

## raahim's memoir 21/8/23
- ramadan
- you can't eat food/drink water/swear during day
- it's not that hard after the few couple of days
- first month of the new lunar year
- for the past couple of years ramadan has been happening in the winter time
- in fact, the new year is already about a month in
- it also depends on where you are
- different places have different times
- it is something you should do at least once in life
- if you have the opportunity to do it, you must do it
- hajj: pilgrimage where they go back to mecca(spiritual birthplace), spiritual center of islam
	- used to be in jerusalem
	- then the prophet got a message from God saying to change direction
- have to pray every day, before the sun sets
- raahim prays in the morning and twice after school
- if he gets home on time, he prays at home
- he also prays in AL1 at school if he has to
- rules and regulations surrounding this
	- is not easy
	- tests faith
- travelling has different rules
	- if you know the direction to face and time, you're allowed to
- does not matter if it's private or public (praying)
- it's not compulsory when you are in the process of travelling
	- you have to make up for it once you've landed
	- as long as there's doubt, you don't have to
	- when you're sure of your surroundings, you have to pray
- Islam started 1400 years ago, around 600 AD
