## The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde 
- Core Concept: Value of reputation 
- People will do anything to make them like them
- **Uses foreshadowing to show that people's outward appearance is important, and one should not investigate it**
- **Uses dialogue to express that people will do anything to hide their alter ego**
- **Uses symbolism to show the extent to which people will hide their alter ego**

### Foreshadowing the ending of the play:
- "I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others…”
- "I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end."

### Dialogue
- "I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed."
- The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. "I do not care to hear more," said he. "This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.
	- Jekyll's emotional side was shown

### Symbolism
- Use of doors is prevalent
- Symbolises the Victorian Era’s preoccupation with the separation of public life and private life
- The front door of Jekyll’s house and the back door of the laboratory, for example, represent physical barriers between the curious eyes of the public and the hidden activities inside
- Hyde's house door is "blistered and destained"
	- Possibly a symbol for how his attempts to hide himself have failed, e.g. the story of the door, and when he tramples an old man

## Hedda Gabler
- Core Concept: **Context influencing Main Ideas**
- Context: 19th Century Europe, the patriarchy was prevalent in most societies
- Ibsen wanted to reflect this in a negative way, and rebel against it, so to speak
- Evident in Hedda's character, in that she wants to be free
- Points
	- **Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms**
	- **Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek**
		- Guns
		- Chekov's gun????
	-  **Uses stereotypical representation of females in order to show how ridiculous said stereotypes are**

### Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms, using foreshadowing
- Hedda is represented as someone who wants freedom
- **Hedda:** You’re quite a formidable person…when it comes to the point.  
  **Brack:** You think so?  
  **Hedda:** Yes, I’m beginning to think so, now. And I’m content…so long as you don’t have any sort of hold over me.
	- Threatens Judge Brack as he blackmails her
	- Claims she is "no longer free"
- **Hedda:** I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny 
  **Mrs Elvsted:** Have you not the power?
  **Hedda:** I have not—and have never had it.
	- Foreshadows her death, as she has the power to end her destiny, so to speak

### Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek
- Symbolism of guns
- Chekov's gun, she kills herself with the guns after being controlled
- Her connection to the guns suggests that Hedda is her father's daughter, not her husband's wife, representing independence
- **Hedda:** Hullo again, Mr. Brack!  
  **Brack:** Good afternoon to you, Mrs. Tesman!  
  **Hedda:** I’m going to shoot you sir!
	- Shows her familiarity with the guns
- **Hedda:** Oh, well…I’ve got one thing at least that I can pass the time with.  
  **Tesman:** Oh, thank the good Lord for that! And what might that be, Hedda? Eh?  **Hedda:** My pistols… Jörgen. 

### Uses dialogue to provide a stereotypical representation of females in order to show how ridiculous said stereotypes are
- **Tesman:** Oh, Auntie…you’ll never stop sacrificing yourself for me!  
  **Miss Tesman:** Isn’t it the only joy I have in the world, to help you along your road, my darling boy?
- **Berte:** I’m really so scared I’ll never give satisfaction to the young mistress.  
  **Miss Tesman:** Oh, Heavens…just to begin with of course there might be this and that…  
  **Berte:** Because she’s ever so particular.
- Hedda is characterised as different, as she knows what she wants and she'll do anything to get it
- Almost manipulative
