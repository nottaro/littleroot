### Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms
- Hedda is represented as someone who wants freedom
- **Hedda:** You’re quite a formidable person…when it comes to the point.  
  **Brack:** You think so?  
  **Hedda:** Yes, I’m beginning to think so, now. And I’m content…so long as you don’t have any sort of hold over me.
	- Threatens Judge Brack as he blackmails her
	- Claims she is "no longer free"
- **Hedda:** I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny 
  **Mrs Elvsted:** Have you not the power?
  **Hedda:** I have not—and have never had it.

### Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek
- Symbolism of guns
- Her connection to the guns suggests that Hedda is her father's daughter, not her husband's wife, representing independence
- **Hedda:** Hullo again, Mr. Brack!  
  **Brack:** Good afternoon to you, Mrs. Tesman!  
  **Hedda:** I’m going to shoot you sir!
	- Shows her familiarity with the guns
- **Hedda:** Oh, well…I’ve got one thing at least that I can pass the time with.  
  **Tesman:** Oh, thank the good Lord for that! And what might that be, Hedda? Eh?  **Hedda:** My pistols… Jörgen. 

### Uses stereotypical representation of females in order to show how ridiculous said stereotypes are
- **Tesman:** Oh, Auntie…you’ll never stop sacrificing yourself for me!  
  **Miss Tesman:** Isn’t it the only joy I have in the world, to help you along your road, my darling boy?
- **Berte:** I’m really so scared I’ll never give satisfaction to the young mistress.  
  **Miss Tesman:** Oh, Heavens…just to begin with of course there might be this and that…  
  **Berte:** Because she’s ever so particular.
- Hedda is characterised as different, as she knows what she wants and she'll do anything to get it
- Almost manipulative
