## Gas Laws
- Describe how gases behave
- Can be predicted by the kinetic theory
- Kinetic theory: all matter consists of tiny particles that are in constant motion
- Real Gases
	- Do have volume
	- Attraction between particles
	- Can condense or solidify
- Ideal Gases
	- No volume
	- No attraction between particles
	- Follows gas laws at all temperatures and pressures
- Real gases differ most from ideal gases at low temperatures and high pressures
- In order to completely describe a gas you need to measure 4 things
	1. Pressure
	2. Temperature
	3. Volume
	4. Number of particles
