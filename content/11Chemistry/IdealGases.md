## Gas Laws
- Describe how gases behave
- Can be predicted by the kinetic theory
- Kinetic theory: all matter consists of tiny particles that are in constant motion
- Real Gases
	- Do have volume
	- Attraction between particles
	- Can condense or solidify
- Ideal Gases
	- No volume
	- No attraction between particles
	- Follows gas laws at all temperatures and pressures
- Real gases differ most from ideal gases at low temperatures and high pressures
- In order to completely describe a gas you need to measure 4 things
	1. Pressure
	2. Temperature
	3. Volume
	4. Number of particles

## Ideal Gas Laws
- Given that the gas is ✨ideal✨
### Boyle's Law
- The pressure of a gas increases as its volume decreases, and vice versa
- tldr: pressure is inversely proportional to volume
- We are assuming:
	1. Constant mass
	2. Constant temperature

### Brownian Motion
- Gas particles move in an irregular, seemingly random path
- Example: smoke
	- When an air particle bombardes a smoke particle, the smoke particle moves to the original direction of the air particle
	- The air particle changes its direction to that of the smoke particle

### Pressure and Temperature
- Pressure
