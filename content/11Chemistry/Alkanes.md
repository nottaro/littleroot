## Hydrocarbons
- Organic Molecule: any molecule that contains carbon
- Hydrocarbon: molecule containing only hydrogen and carbon

## Alkanes
- Hydrocarbon with all single bonds
- Thus, it is a saturated hydrocarbon
- $C_n H_{2n+2}$

### Chemical Properties of Alkanes
- Combustion:

#### Combustion
- Complete combustion: there is an excess of $O_2$
- Incomplete combustion: there is a limited supply of $O_2$
