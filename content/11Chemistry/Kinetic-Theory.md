## Boyle's Law

$$PV=nRT=k$$
- The ideal gas law
	- P = pressure, in kPa
		- Newton/area
		- 1 atm (atmosphere) ~ 100 kPa
	- V = volume, in L
	- n = moles
	- R = universal gas constant
		- 8.3145
	- T = temperature
		- Kinetic energy
- Works for all gases, as long as they "behave"
- All gases deviate at low temperatures and high pressures
- STP: standard temperature and pressure
	- 25 ˚C, and 100 kPa
	- 1 mole of gas at STP takes up 22.7 L of space
- Absolute 0: temperature at 0 Kelvins where movement of all particles stops

## Gas Pressure
- Gases consist of particles in constant random motion, spread a long ay apart
- When gases collide with the walls of their container, each collision exerts a force. 
- This causes a pressure to be exerted on the walls of the container, i.e. **a force per unit area**
- Measured in Pascals, 1 Pa = $1 \frac{N}{m^2}$
- We also measure pressure in atmospheres, where 1 atm = 101.3 kPa

## Kinetic Theory
- The kinetic theory of gases links the macroscopic behaviour of a gas with its microscopic behaviour
- **In macroscopic terms**,  a gas is a phase of matter that has a fixed mass and whose volume is equal to the volume of its container. 
	- The gas exerts pressure on the walls of the container
- **In microscopic terms**, a gas is a collection of many particles that collide with each other and with the container walls
- The kinetic theory relates the pressure exerted by a gas to the motion of its particles
- The kinetic theory of gases was developed from experimental evidence to explain the similar behaviours of all gases
- Mathematical relationships between pressure, volume, moles and temperature have been derived for an **ideal gas**, that is one that obeys all the equations perfectly
- There is no such thing as an ideal gas - no real gases behave exactlly as the laws describe.
	- However, under normal conditions, almost all gases follow the ideal gas model very closely
- Real gases deviate most from ideal gas behaviour at very low temperatures and very high pressures
- Gases with small particles like H and He follow the ideal gas laws most closely
	- Smaller particles means less collisions

### Ideal Gas assumptions
- When describing an ideal gas, the following assumptions are made
1. The motion of all particles is random
2. All particles travel in straight lines
3. intermolecular (electrostatic) and gravitational forces are negligible
4. All particles of a particular gas are identical and perfect spheres
5. Internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic
6. All collisions between particles and the walls of the container are completely elastic (no loss of kinetic energy)
7. Particles take up negligible volume (pressure is due to mobility)
8. Newton's Laws of Motion apply
	1. An object travelling at a constant velocity, or at rest, will remain at that constant velocity or at rest, unless acted upon by an external force. i.e., inertia
	2. Force is equal to mass times acceleration
	3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction

## Kinetic Energy and Temperature
- An important aspect of kinetic theory is that temperature is related to average kinetic energy of the particles
- However there is a range of kinetic energy values for the particles at any particular temperature - some move faster, and some move slower than the average
- The **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** describes the distribution of kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature
	- y axis is number of particles in a sample
	- x axis is energy

- At a given tempreature, particles of all gases have the same distribution of kinetic energies, no matter what size their particles are. 
- The relationship between kinetic energy, mass, and velocity is $e = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- This means that particles with a greater mass with have a lower average velocitiy, and vice versa

## Measuring Temperature
- The **absolute** or **thermoidynamic scale of temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. 
- Measured in degrees **Kelvin** (K)
- When temperature is measured in Kelvin, the temperature of a substance is directly proportiona to the average kinetic energy of its particles
- Absolute temperature starts at **absolute zero** - the theoretical lowest possible temperature, at which point the particles would have no kinetic energy
- The absolut sacle jhas units of the same magnitude as the celsius scale
- Converting to and from Kelivn and degrees Celsiuis
$$T(K)=T(˚C)+273.15$$
$$T(˚C)=T(K)-273.15$$
