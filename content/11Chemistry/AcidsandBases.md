- Salt: Substance formed when hydrogen in an acid is substituted by a metal ion

- For a group 1 metal M: $M^+$

| Acid       | Salt       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| $HCl$      | $MCl$      |
| $HNO_3$    | $MNO_3$    |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $MHSO_4$   |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $M_2 SO_4$ |
|            |            |

### Humphrey Davy Acid-Base Theory
- Acids are substances that contain hydrogen
- Not all acids contain oxygen
- **Flaw:** Not all hydrogen-containing substances are acids

### Svante Arrhenius Acid-Base Theory
- Acids dissociate in water forming $H^+$ ions as one product
- Bases dissociate in water forming $OH^-$ ions as one product
- Neutralisation involves the reaction of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ (an acid and a base) forming a salt in water
