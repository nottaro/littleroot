- Salt: Substance formed when hydrogen in an acid is substituted by a metal ion

- For a group 1 metal M: $M^+$

| Acid       | Salt       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| $HCl$      | $MCl$      |
| $HNO_3$    | $MNO_3$    |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $MHSO_4$   |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $M_2 SO_4$ |
|            |            |


- An acid is a proton donor
-  A base is a proton acceptor

### The Role of Water
- Acid-base reactions occur in aqueous solutions
- Water can accept or donate protons; it can act as an acid or a base
$$HCl+H_2 O \rightarrow Cl^- + H_3 O^+$$
$$H_2O + NH_3 \rightleftharpoons OH^- + NH_4 ^+$$
- $H_3O^+$ is the hydronium ion
- Acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions but the proton $H^+$ is never found on its own
- It is alwways bonded to water (dative bond) in an aqueous solution
- I.e. $H^+_{(aq)}$ exists as $H_3O^+_{(aq)}$

## Theories
### Humphrey Davy Acid-Base Theory
- Acids are substances that contain hydrogen
- Not all acids contain oxygen
- **Flaw:** Not all hydrogen-containing substances are acids

### Svante Arrhenius Acid-Base Theory
- Acids dissociate in water forming $H^+$ ions as one product
- Bases dissociate in water forming $OH^-$ ions as one product
- Neutralisation involves the reaction of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ (an acid and a base) forming a salt in water
- **Flaws**
	- Theories only apply to aqueous solutions
	- Some substances such as $NH_3$ are bases and do not contain $OH^-$
	- Relative strengths are not addressed
	- Amphoteric substances are not addressed
