- Salt: Substance formed when hydrogen in an acid is substituted by a metal ion

- For a group 1 metal M: $M^+$

| Acid       | Salt       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| $HCl$      | $MCl$      |
| $HNO_3$    | $MNO_3$    |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $MHSO_4$   |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $M_2 SO_4$ |
|            |            |


- An acid is a proton donor
-  A base is a proton acceptor

### The Role of Water
- Acid-base reactions occur in aqueous solutions
- Water can accept or donate protons; it can act as an acid or a base
$$HCl+H_2 O \rightarrow Cl^- + H_3 O^+$$
$$H_2O + NH_3 \rightleftharpoons OH^- + NH_4 ^+$$
- $H_3O^+$ is the hydronium ion
- Acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions but the proton $H^+$ is never found on its own
- It is alwways bonded to water (dative bond) in an aqueous solution
- I.e. $H^+_{(aq)}$ exists as $H_3O^+_{(aq)}$

## Theories
### Humphrey Davy Acid-Base Theory
- Acids are substances that contain hydrogen
- Not all acids contain oxygen
- **Flaw:** Not all hydrogen-containing substances are acids

### Svante Arrhenius Acid-Base Theory
- Acids dissociate in water forming $H^+$ ions as one product
- Bases dissociate in water forming $OH^-$ ions as one product
- Neutralisation involves the reaction of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ (an acid and a base) forming a salt in water
- **Flaws**
	- Theories only apply to aqueous solutions
	- Some substances such as $NH_3$ are bases and do not contain $OH^-$
	- Relative strengths are not addressed
	- Amphoteric substances are not addressed

## Strong and Weak Acids
- Acids ionise in aqueous solutions, releasing protons
- Strong acids (hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric) completely ionise in an aqueous solution
$$HCl+H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + Cl^-$$
$$H_2 SO_4 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_3O^+ + SO_4^{2-}$$
$$HNO_3 + H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + NO_3^-$$
- A dilute solution of hydrochloric acid is a strong acid
- Weak acids (e.g. carboxylic acids) only partially ionise in aqueous solutions
$$CH_3COOH + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^- + H_3O^+$$
- About 4 in every 1000 ethanoic acid molecules are ionised in a dilute solution
- A concentrated ethanoic acid is a weak acid

| Strong    | Weak      |
| --------- | --------- |
| $HCl$     | $H_3PO_4$ |
| $HNO_3$   | $H_2CO_3$ |
| $H_2SO_4$ | $HF$      |
| $HBr$     | $HCl_3$   |
| $HI$      | $H_2CO_4$ |
| $HClO_4$  | $HSO_4^-$ |

## Strong and Weak Bases
- Bases dissociate in aqueous solutions
- Strong bases fully dissociate in aqueous solutions
$$NaOH_{(aq)} \rightarrow Na^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)} $$
- A dilute solution of sodium hydroxide is a strong base

| Strong     | Weak        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| $NaOH$     | $NH_4OH$    |
| $KOH$      | $CO_3^{2-}$ |
| $Ba(OH)_2$ | $NH_3$      |
| $Sr(OH)_2$ | $F^-$       |
| $Ca(OH)_2$ | $CH_3COO^-$ |

## Electrolytes
- Electrolytes are substances that dissolve in water and form ions
- Strong electrolytes are good conductors of electricity in an aqueous solution because water causes them to dissociate (ionic compounds) or completely ionise (covalent molecules)


## Reactions of Acids with Metals
$$Metal+Acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt + H_2$$
$$Metal\ oxide + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt_{(maybe)} + H_2O_{(l)}$$
$$Metal\ hydroxide + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt + H_2O_{(l)}$$
$$Metal \ carbonate + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt + H_2O_{(l)}+CO_2{(g)}$$
$$Metal\ hydrogencarbonate + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt +$$


- Metal oxides are always solid, unless specified otherwise
