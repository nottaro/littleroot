## Energy
- Energy: capacity to do work
- Work: exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change
- Exothermic reaction gives out heat
- Endothermic reaction absorbs heat

### Direct + Indirect uses of Energy
**Direct**
-   Burning petrol to power a car
-   Burn car to power a steam train
-   Burn natural gas to use a stove to cook eggs
**Indirect**
-   Takes energy to process crude oil to separate petrol. Then consumers use the petrol to power the car
-   Burning coal to spin turbines to generate electricity to charge a laptop. Consumers use the energy stored in the laptop
-   Truck bringing of diesel to transport eggs to consumers

## Greenhouse Effect
- Complete combustion: reacts with air to produce carbon dioxide and water
- Incomplete combustion: reacts with air to produce carbon monoxide and water, or carbon and water

With the burning of fossil fuels, we put a lot of carbon dioxide into the air. 

Cause + Effect enhanced
1.  Extra burning of fossil fuels
2.  Enhanced greenhouse effect
3.  Average global temperatures rise
4.  Ice melting and sea level rises

## Fractional Distillation
- A method of separating fractions of crude oil
	- Crude oil: all unprocessed oil, a mixture of hydrocarbons with different chain lengths
	-  Fractions: a group of hydrocarbons with a similar length chain
- The longer the molecule, the greater the intermolecular forces, therefore the greater amount of energy required to break the bonds
- **Crude oil fractions**
	-   Refined gas
	-   Petrol
	-   Naphtha
	-   Wax
	-   Bitumen

### Steps
1.  **Crude oil is heated in a furnace**
2.  **The heated crude oil, mostly in a vapour state, is pumped into the column and travels very fast due to its energy**
3.  **The column has a heat gradient, and decreases in temperature going up, with the very bottom being very hot**
4.  **The constituents that have higher boiling points will collect at lower points and condense, while substances with lower boiling points will rise higher and condense at higher points due to the higher areas being cooler (increasing boiling points)**
	1.  **Gas**
	2.  **Petrol**
	3.  **Naphtha**
	4.  **Kerosene**
	5.  **Diesel**
	6.  **Bitumen**
5.  **Shorter chain molecules have lower boiling points and will therefore reach the higher area**
6.  **The condensations are collected**

## Hydrocarbons

### **Functional Groups and Homologous Series**
-   Functional group: atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule
-   Homologous series is a group of molecules with the same functional group but a different number of -CH2 groups
-   Family that differs by number of carbon atoms
-   Functional groups determine the pattern of reactivity of a homologous series, whereas the carbon chain length determines physical properties such as melting/boiling points

## **Carbon**
-   Bonding capacity: 4
-   Can form 4 covalent bonds
-   4 valence electrons
-   Sharing 1 electron forms a covalent bond
-   Carbon can make double or triple covalent bonds

## **Saturated Hydrocarbons**
-   Hydrocarbons with only single bonds between carbon atoms
-   Simplest class of hydrocarbons
-   Each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible
-   Makes them relatively unreactive/un-volatile, apart from their interaction with the oxygen in the air in the case of combustion
  
## **Structural Isomers**
-   Isomers: organic molecules with the same molecular formula but a different structural formula
-   Structural isomers have:
	-   Different names
	-   Different shapes
	-   Different chemical properties
-   Read from left to right for isomers

## **Alkanes**
-   Family of hydrocarbons
-   Saturated hydrocarbons with only single bonds between the carbon atoms
-   Can be arranged in continuous straight chains or in branches or rings
-   Hydrogen = 2 x carbon + 2


### **Naming Alkanes: Branched**

1.  Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule
2.  Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain. Start at the end that will give the smallest numbers possible to the carbon atoms where the branches originate
3.  Substituents = atoms attached to the parent chain. **Alkyl group:** A substituent that is a hydrocarbon. The names of alkyl groups use the same prefixes as the alkanes, but with a -yl suffix, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. Substituents are named by placing the carbon number from the parent carbon chain in front of the name with the substituent. 
4.  Use a prefix to indicate the appearance of more than one of the same substituent in the structural formula. 2 of the same group is di-, 3 is tri-, 4 is tetra
5.  Multiple different substituents are listed in alphabetical order. Ignore any of the prefixes from rule 4.
6.  Commas are used to separate multiple numbers. Hyphens come between the number and name of a substituent. The parent name comes immediately after the last substituent. There are no spaces in the name

### **Melting and boiling points: Alkanes**
-   Alkanes have low melting or boiling points
-   Due to very weak intermolecular forces between alkane molecules
-   Methane, ethane and butane are gases at room temperature
-   As the carbon chain gets longer, because the attraction between the molecules increases, therefore more energy is needed to overcome the attraction 
-   Branched isomers have lower boiling/melting points, because the branches prevent the molecules from getting close so they cannot attract to each other as strongly

### **Van der Waal’s forces**
-   Named after Dutch scientist J D Van der Waal who discovered them
-   The forces are created by the constant movements of electrons in atoms of molecules at high speeds
-   At any instant in time there is the likelihood that one side of the molecule has a greater proportion of electrons
-   This is called a dipole, and causes the molecule to have positively and negatively charged ends
-   A temporary dipole or imbalance of charge can attract the electron cloud from a neighbouring atom or molecule, e.g. slightly positive end attracts negatively charged electrons
-   The temporary dipole induces an imbalance of charges in neighbouring molecules
-   The strength of the VdW force is dependent on the size of the molecules or atoms
-   As the size and molecular mass of the molecule increases so does the number of electrons, resulting in a greater imbalance of charge, and therefore a greater VdW attraction
-   This is why boiling points increase as the number of carbon atoms increase in alkanes, more energy is required to overcome the VdW forces

### **Viscosity of Alkanes**
-   Methane, ethane, propane, butane = gases at room temperature
-   Alkanes from pentane through to C16 are liquids
-   The viscosity of liquid alkanes increases as the number of carbon atoms increase
-   The increase in viscosity is due to the increase of intermolecular forces between molecules of increasing size

### **Volatility of Alkanes**
-   High volatility: low boiling point
-   High volatility: weak intermolecular forces, thus fewer number of carbons in straight chain the higher the volatility

### **Chemical Properties of Alkanes**
-   Combustion
	-   Alkanes are flammable
	-   Complete combustion (lots of oxygen present) produces carbon dioxide and water
	-   Incomplete combustion (limited oxygen present) produces carbon monoxide and water

## **Alkenes**
-   Alkenes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one double bond between 2 carbon atoms
-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons
-   C=C double bond
-   The double bond is the functional group of the alkene homologous series
-   **Hydrogen = 2*carbon**

### **Naming Alkenes: Straight Chain** 
-   Alkenes with carbon atoms arranged in a continuous straight line
-   Retain the prefixes **Eth, Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct** for the parent compound
-   Parent chain is the long chain containing the C=C
-   Number the chain from the end that gives the C=C the lowest number
-   Family suffix name: ene

### **Naming Alkenes: Structural Isomerism**
-   Alkenes containing 4+ carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, structural isomerism occurs
-   e.g. C4 alkene C4H8 has 2 isomers
-   Use the lower number of C where the double bond occurs for suffix n-ene
-   The prefixes are still the same for alkanes  

1.  Find the parent chain = longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule with the C=C, this is given the stem name n-ene
2.  Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain that will give the C=C the lowest number
3.  Name the side chains in the same way as with alkanes

### **Geometrical Structural Isomers**

-   There is no rotation possible around a double bond
-   2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different
-   Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond
-   Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond

## **Properties of Alkenes**
-   Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the relatively instability of the double bond
-   Breaking a carbon-carbon bond from a double bond between carbon atoms requires less energy than breaking a C-C bond
-   The boiling and melting points of alkenes are generally slightly lower than alkanes with the same amounts of carbon atoms.
-   The boiling point of straight-chain alkenes is more than branched-chain alkenes just as in alkanes
-   Alkenes with 2-4 carbon atoms = gases at room temperature
-   Alkenes with 5-17 carbon atoms = liquids at room temperature
-   Viscosity of alkenes increases with increased carbon chain length
-   Volatility of alkenes decreases with increased carbon chain length

## **Alkynes**
-   Alkynes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one triple bond between 2 carbon atoms
-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons
-   C☰C triple bond
-   The triple bond is the functional group of the alkyne homologous series’
-   Hydrogen = 2*carbon - 2

### **Naming Alkynes: Straight chain**
-   Alkynes with carbon atoms arranged in a continuous straight line
-   Retain the prefixes **Eth, Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct** for the parent compound
-   Parent compound is the longest chain containing the C☰C
-   Number the chain from the end that gives the C☰C the lowest number
-   Family name suffix: yne

### **Properties of Alkynes**
-   Ethyne, propyne and butyne = gases, C5-C12 = liquid
-   Boiling points
	-   Compared to alkanes and alkenes, alkynes have a slightly higher boiling point
-   Viscosity of alkynes increases with increased carbon chain length
-   Volatility of alkynes decreases with increased carbon chain length

## **Cycloalkanes**
-   Rings of carbon atoms with distinguishing chemical properties = cycloalkanes
-   Cycloalkanes only contain carbon-hydrogen bonds and carbon-carbon single bonds, but in cycloalkanes, the carbon atoms are joined in a ring
-   The smallest cycloalkane is cyclopropane
-   Hydrogen = 2*carbon

### **Naming Cycloalkanes**
-   Use the number of carbons in the ring to determine the prefix **Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct**
-   Suffix = n-ane
-   Place cyclo- in front

## **Cycloalkenes**
-   Hydrogen = 2*(carbon - number of double bonds)

## **Naming Cycloalkenes**
-   Use the number of carbons in the ring to determine the prefix **Prop, But, Pent, Hex, Hept, Oct**
-   Suffix = ene 
-   Place cyclo- in front

## **Alcohols**
-   Homologous group of carbon compounds containing the hydroxyl (-OH) group
-   Methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc
-   General formula Cn, H2n+1, OH

# **Combustion**
- Combustion: substance burns in the presence of oxygen
	-   Reaction between a substance and oxygen that releases heat and light energy
- Fuel: substance that reacts with oxygen (combusts) to produce useful energy
- Many fractions obtained from crude oil are used as fuels because they contain hydrocarbons that burn easily and release a large amount of useful energy
- Complete combustion: lots of oxygen present
	-   Hydrocarbon + oxygen —> Carbon dioxide + water + energy
- If there is a shortage of air(oxygen), incomplete combustion takes place
- Incomplete combustion: limited oxygen present
	-   Hydrocarbon + oxygen —> Carbon dioxide + water + energy
	-   Still yields carbon dioxide and water
	-   However, it produces toxic by-products, in CO and C
	-   Also releases less energy than complete oxygen
	-   Carbon monoxide is poisonous because it reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen, and reduces the ability of blood to expel carbon dioxide

### **Balancing equations: Combustion**
1.  Balance C
2.  Balance H
3.  If oxygen is an odd number, times everything by 2

Heat of combustion is used to refer to the amount of heat released during a combustion reaction
-   Involves combustion of a measured mass of alcohol to heat a measured mass of water over a measured temperature rise
-   It is assumed that the total heat released by the combustion reaction will be absorbed by the water

The heat of combustion can be calculated with:$$\Delta H=mc \Delta t$$
-   ∆H: change in enthalpy (j)
-   m: mass of heated substance (g)
-   c: specific heat capacity of heated substance (˚C)
-   ∆T: change in temperature of heated substance

# **Isomers**
- Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula (i.e. same number and type of atoms) but in which the atoms are arranged in a different way
- There are 2 main categories of isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism

### **Structural Isomerisms**
-   Different structural formulae
-   Chain isomerism
-   Carbon chain is arranged differently, e.g. different shape, L shape instead of chain, cross shape
-   Positional isomerism
-   Functional group is attached to a different carbon atom, e.g. 3-chloropentane, 2-chloropentane
-   Also exists in alkenes with 4 or more carbon atoms
-   Functional group isomerism
-   Have different functional groups, so are members of different homologous series

### **Stereoisomerism**
-   Have same structural formula
-   3d arrangement of atoms is different
-   2 types
-   Cis-trans isomerism
-   Optical isomerism

	### **Cis-trans isomerism**
	-   Molecules can rotate freely around C-C covalent bonds, but not around C=C double bonds
	-   Leads to cis-trans isomerism, in which isomers differ in the arrangement of the groups attached to the carbons in the double bonds
	-   These isomers cannot be super imposed on each other because the arrangement of the methyl groups is different
	-   If an alkyl group or atom other than hydrogen is attached to each carbon then the atoms can be named either **cis** (on the same side) or **trans** (on the opposite side)
	
	**Limitations of Cis-Trans isomerism**
	-   In more complex organic compounds, in which multiple hydrogens have been substituted by different groups, isomers cannot be defined using the **cis-trans** notation
	-   Instead, a different system is used for these type of molecules: **E-Z notation**

### **E-Z Notation**
-   Used to identify stereoisomers that cannot be called cis or trans
-   Isomers are identified as either E or Z depending on what “priority” is given to the groups attached to the carbon atoms in the double bond
-   Priority of these groups is determined by a series of complex rules
-   **E** represents the German word “entgegen” and corresponds to trans isomers
-   The highest priority groups are on the opposite side of the double bond
-   **Z** represents the German word “zusammen” and corresponds to cis isomers
-   The highest priority groups are on the same side of the double bond

### **Optical isomerism**
-   A molecule can exist as 2 isomers that are non-superimposable, mirror images of each other, just like a left hand and right hand
-   Optical isomers have the same physical properties but they rotate polarised light in opposite directions

# **Energy in Chemical Change**

## **Understanding Energy**
-   Energy: capacity to do work
-   Measured in Joules
-   Can be transferred or transformed
-   Can therefore come in different forms
	-   Potential energy
	-   Chemical energy
	-   Nuclear energy
	-   Mechanical energy
	-   Elastic energy
	-   Gravitational energy
	-   Kinetic energy
	-   Heat energy
	-   Light energy
	-   Electrical energy
	-   Sound energy
-   Enthalpy: changes taking place in a chemical reaction
-   Total energy present in a reaction
-   △H = H(products) - H(reactants)
-   H: enthalpy
-   △H: change in enthalpy

**2 prefixes: system and surroundings**

**System**: the area in which the chemical reaction happens

**Surroundings**: Contents outside the system that energy is transferred to/from

**2 types of reactions**

Exothermic reactions: transfers energy from system to surroundings
-   Energy is released
-   Bonds are broken
-   Heat is transferred/released from system to surroundings

Endothermic reactions: transfers energy from surroundings to system
-   Heat is transferred/absorbed from surroundings to system

Energy is stored in chemical bonds, known as chemical potential energy, or bond energy

Exothermic reactions have a negative value for △H, meaning enthalpy has decreased for the duration of the reaction
-   Happens if chemical potential energy is converted to particle kinetic energy, e.g. increase in temperature
-   Overall chemical potential energy is conserved in the form of heat
-   However, this raises the system’s temperature, so heat flows away from the system to the surroundings
-   The loss of heat energy from the system to the surroundings means that enthalpy has decreased

Endothermic reactions have a positive value for △H, meaning enthalpy has increased for the duration of the reaction 
-   Particle kinetic energy is converted to chemical potential energy
-   Reduction of particle kinetic energy means reacting system’s temperature will fall
-   Heat flows from the surroundings to the system, increasing enthalpy

## **Representing Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions**
-   Enthalpy change can be shown graphically using an energy profile graph, or it can be written along with the equation 
-   Sometimes the heat absorbed or released during the reaction is written into the equation, rather than giving the enthalpy change
![](Info%20Images/Exothermic.png)
![](Info%20Images/Activation%20energy.png)
![](Info%20Images/Exothermic%20reaction.png)
- When a catalyst is used, less energy is needed for a reaction to occur
- Activation energy: amount of energy required to start/sustain reaction
- catalyst: substance that lowers activation energy of the reaction, and is not consumed during the reaction

# Definitions
**Viscosity**: thickness of fluid, how resistant a fluid is to movement through it
**Volatility**: a measure of how readily a substance vaporises or transitions from a liquid phase to a gas phase
**Melting point:** temperature at which matter changes from solid to liquid form
**Boiling point:** temperature at which matter changes from liquid to gas form
**Fossil**: preserved remains or traces of a living thing
**Fossil fuel**: Substances that were formed from decaying animal and plant matter being submitted to high temperatures and pressure over millions of years. Rich deposits of hydrocarbon mixtures that formed from the remains of organisms
**Energy**: The ability to do work
**Direct energy consumption**: Energy we use, e.g. burning of fossil fuels for our car. Energy that people consume through their own activities. Includes lighting, heat, and fuel for transport
**Indirect energy consumption**: Energy cost of an item associated with production. Includes electricity and energy used to grow food, manufacturing, etc
**Organic chemistry:** Study of carbon and carbon based compounds. This excludes metallic carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, and oxides of carbon.
**Organic compound**: a carbon based compound. Carbon always forms **4 covalent bonds**
**Hydrocarbon**: a compound that contains only carbon and hydrogen. Crude oil contains naturally occurring hydrocarbons
**Crude oil**: a complex mixture of hydrocarbons formed by geological action on decayed aquatic plant and animal matter over millions of years. Hydrocarbons are separated from others through fractional distillation
**Fractional distillation**: the first step in oil refinement. Since boiling points of molecules increase as molecule’s mass increases, separation is roughly in order of increasing numbers of carbon atoms per molecule. The crude oil mixture is heated, fractions turn into vapour, rise, condense, and the liquid is collected. Usually the fraction is still a mixture and requires further refining
