- **Electrostatic force of attraction between shared pair of electrons and the nuclei on either side**
- Non-metal atoms involved
- Covalent bonding: Non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons by overlapping valence shells to give each a nobel gas structure
- A covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons
- There is a force of attraction between the bonding pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms at each side
- Hydrogen atoms only need 2 electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium
- Octet Rule: Atoms gain, lose or share eelectrons when they combine with other atoms to acquire a stable octet (8) of electrons
- There are exceptions: $SF_6$ and $BCl_3$ 

## Properties
- Non-conductors of electricity
	- Electrons are localised in the electron cloud or as bonding pairs
	- Therefore, they are immobile, and cannot conduct charge
- Bad conductors of heat
	- No free particles that can move from one end of the particle to another, carrying kinetic energy (temperature)
	- Thus, it is a bad conductor of heat
- Soft
	- Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules and so these molecules can be easily separated and rearranged when a force is applied, making them soft
- Low melting/boiling point
	- Only weak intermolecular forces exist between the molecules
	- Small amount of energy is need to overcome these bonds, and there is a low melting/boiling point
	- These increase with molecular size, which increases the strength of the bonds

Note: These are for Covalent Molecular Structures, not Covalent Network Structures, which you do not need to know
