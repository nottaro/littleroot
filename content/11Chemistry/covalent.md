- Non-metal atoms involved
- Covalent bonding: Non-metal atoms share one or more pairrs of electrons by overlapping valence shells to give each a nobel gass structure
- A covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons
- There is a force of attraction between the bonding pair of electrons and the nuceli of the atoms at each side
- Hydrogen atoms only need 2 electrons in their outer level to reach the noble gas structure of helium
- Octet Rule: Atoms gain, lose or share eelectrons when they combine with other atoms to acquire a stable octet (8) of electrons
