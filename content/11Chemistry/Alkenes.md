- Unsaturated hydrocarbon
- Has a double bond
- General formula: $C_n H_{2n}$

### **Geometrical Structural Isomers**
- There is no rotation possible around a double bond
- 2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different
- Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond
- Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond
#### Criteria
- Double Bond between carbons (C=C)
- 2 different groups attached
