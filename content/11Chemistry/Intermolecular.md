-   Forces between molecules
-   Allotropes: Different physical forms of the same element
    -   E.g., carbon, diamond, graphite
-   Gases: Very weak attraction between particles
-   Liquid: stronger attraction between particles
-   Solids: Very strong attraction between particles
- Also known as Van Der Waal's forces

## Dispersion Forces
- Forces existing between 2 polar molecules
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 oppositely charged temporary/induced dipoles
- Electrons move randomly; thus dipoles are temporary, as their charges is based on these electrons, as their localisation is temporary
- Molecules with dipoles can polarise other molecules and make them form temporary dipoles - these are called induced dipoles
- This ESF of attraction between the temporary and induced dipoles are known as dispersion forces
- These are temporary, as electrons move randomly, therefore the dipoles form, break apart, and reform randomly

## Permanent Dipole-Dipole
- Forces present betwween 2 polar molecules
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 net dipoles; i.e. partially positive end of one dipole, and partially negative end of another, and vice versa
- Stronger than dispersion forces
	- They are permanent
	- There is a greater separation of charge, and therefore a greater ESF of attraction between the 2 dipoles
- Stronger than intramolecular forces
- Relatively weak compared to metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds
