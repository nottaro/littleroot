### Sieving
- A porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes
- Method is most common used to affect gross separations, e.g. liquids from suspended crystals or other solids
- To accelerate sieving, pressure is usually applied
- A series of sieves is stacked, with the screen of largest hole size at the top

### Decantation
- Done to separate particulates form a liquid by allowing the solids to settle to the bottom of the mixture and pouring off the particle free part of the liquid
- Allows 2 immiscible liquids to separate and the lighter liquid is poured off

### Filtration
- Used to separate heterogenous mixtures composed of solids and liquids
- Uses a porous barrier to separate the solid from the liquid
- Smaller particles of liquid passes through, leaving the solid in the filter paper

### Distillation
- Used to separate homogenous mixtures
- Based on difference in boiling points of substances involved

### Evaporation
- Solution is heated, and becomes more concentrated
- Eventually, all of the solvent will disappear
- The solute will crystallise at the bottom

### Crystallisation
- The solvent is dissolved in
