- Solute: Substance can be dissolved
- Residue: Substance that cannot be dissolved

### Ion-dipole forces 
- Electrostatic force of attraction between an ion and a polar molecule
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between an ion and a dipole
- Note: "Intermolecular force" is a misnomer, as this is in ionic substances, not covalent substances
- Stronger than permanent dipole-dipole and dispersion forces

## Soluble or Insoluble?
- Solutions form when solvent and solute mix
- Process involves breaking bonds/attraction in these individual substances, which is endothermic, thus it requires energy
- In the solution, attractions form between the solvent and solute, and this bond formation is exothermic, releasing energy
- Whether the solution forms overall depends on whether the overall process is energetically favourable
	- i.e. if the amount of energy released from forming solute-solvent bonds is greater than the amount of energy breaking solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds
- Dissolving can be exothermic or endothermic, but if too much energy is required, it won't happen
- **Like dissolves like** (do not use this phrase)
	- If the solvent and solute are able to form good intermolecular bonds with each other, this will favour dissolving
	- Polar solvents and polar solutes can form dipole-dipole interaction (and sometimes H-bonds), which favours dissolving
	- Non-polar substances cannot form dipole-dipole interactions or h-bonds, so won' mix with polar substances
	- Non-polar solutes dissolve well in non-polar solvents. All substances form only dispersion forces, meaning no strong bonds are broken

## Water - The Universal Solvent
- As a highly polar molecule, water is great at dissolving polar molecule substances and many ionic substances
- Water can form a range of intermolecular forces to stabilise a solution
	- Dipole-dipole forces with polar molecules
	- Hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bonding polar molecules
	- Ion-dipole forces with ions from ionic compounds


## Identifying negative ions: Halides
- Formed from group 17 elements, the halogens
- Detected using silver nitrate solutions
- Colourless ions in a solution
- $I^-,Cl^-,Br^-$ 
- The different silver halide precipitates can be distinguished by their differing colours
	- Chloride: white AgCl precipitate
	- Bromide: cream AgBr precipitate
	- Iodide: yellow AgI precipitate

## Isolating the Precipitate
- Precipitate from a precipitation reaction can be separated from the reaction mixture by filtration


## Solubility
- Concentration of a saturated solution
- **Saturated**: Solution where no more solution will dissolve at the given temperature
- **Unsaturated**: Less solute than needed to make a saturated solution. Most solutions we use will be unsaturated
- **Supersaturated**: Unstable solution, usually formed as a saturated solution curves down. If it is disturbed, it will crystallise, forming crystals of solute, and leave a saturated solution
- **Solubility**: Mass of a substance that will dissolve in 100 g of water at 25Ëš C
- The solubility of a substance depends on the temperature of the solvent

### Solubility Curves
- Solubility curves show the solubility of substances as temperature changes
- Generally, the solubility of ionic solids increases with temperature
	- There is more energy to overcome bonding in the solid

### Saturation and crystallisation
- Solutions become supersaturated when they contain more solute than they would normally be able to dissolve
- this can happen when a saturated solution is cooled, or another change in conditions occurs that causes solubility to decrease
