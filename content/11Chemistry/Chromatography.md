title: Chromatography
---

- Series of analytical techniques that can be used to separate mixtures of compounds for further use or for analysis
- In all forms of chromatography, a **mobile phase** moves through or across a **stationary phase**
- **Stationary phase**: This phase does not move. 
	- Compounds in the mixture are attracted to it (adsorbed) and slowed down.
	- Either a solid or a liquid
- **Mobile Phase**: This phase moves.
	- The more soluble compounds in the mixture are carried faster as the mobile phase moves. 
	- Either a liquid or a gas

## Paper Chromatography
- Used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments
- Dots of single dyes are placed alongside a dot of the unknown mixture
- The solvent is drawn up the paper by capillary action
- As the solvent moves up the paper, the pattern of the single dyes can be compared to that of the unknown mixture
