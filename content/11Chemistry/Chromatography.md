- Series of analytical techniques that can be used to separate mixtures of compounds for further use or for analysis
- In all forms of chromatography, a **mobile phase** moves through or across a **stationary phase**
- **Stationary phase**: This phase does not move. 
	- Compounds in the mixture are attracted to it (adsorbed) and slowed down.
	- Either a solid or a liquid
- **Mobile Phase**: This phase moves.
	- The more soluble compounds in the mixture are carried faster as the mobile phase moves. 
	- Either a liquid or a gas

## Paper Chromatography
- Used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments
- Dots of single dyes are placed alongside a dot of the unknown mixture
- The solvent is drawn up the paper by capillary action
- As the solvent moves up the paper, the pattern of the single dyes can be compared to that of the unknown mixture
- The distance the solvent travels relies upon its polarity
- The more polar molecules will be more adsorbed to the paper, and thus will travel less

## Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)
- All chromatography involves a stationary phase and a mobile phase
- Stationary phase is a **layer of silica gel** fixed on a rigid glass plate
- The mobile phase is a solvent which travels up the plate, carrying the substances
- Uses same principles as paper chromatography
	- Capillary cation still draws the solvent up the matrix
	- However, while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mace, in TLC, separation often depends on solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix
	- A dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it
	- Some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to the silica gel than others so they lag behind the solvent
		- The more polar molecules have a stronger IMF between itself and the gel, thus it sticks more strongly, and lags
	- Eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance
