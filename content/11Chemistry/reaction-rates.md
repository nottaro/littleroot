title: Rates of Reaction
---

[go back](11Subjects/11Chemistry.md)

- The speed at which a reaction happens
$$Rate=\frac{\Delta[Reactants]}{\Delta t}\ mol L^{-1}s^{-1}$$
- \[Reactants] is concentration
- For a reaction to happen, particles must collide
- The reaction is complete ~~when sin(Î¸)=1, where $\theta$ is equal to the angle between the perpendicular line to the curve~~ when the volume of gas produced does not change further
