There is a production externality, because over and above the firm’s private costs of production, there are additional costs that spill over onto society due to the polluted air and ocean, with negative consequences for the local inhabitants, swimmers, sea life, the fishing industry and the marine ecosystem. This is shown in the Figure, where the supply curve, S = MPC, reflects the firm’s private costs of production, and the marginal social cost curve given by MSC represents the full cost to society of producing cement.
<img src=https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump//11SubjectImages/negativeproductionexternality.png width=auto alt></p><p>For each level of output, Q, social costs of producing cement given by MSC are greater than the firm’s private costs. The vertical difference between MSC and MPC represents the external costs. Since the externality involves only production (the supply curve), the demand curve represents both marginal private benefits and marginal social benefits. The Figure illustrates a general point that you should keep in mind whenever you examine (or draw) an externality diagram: the free market outcome is determined by the intersection of MPB and MPC, resulting in quantity $Q_m$ and price $P_m$. The social optimum (or ‘best’) outcome is given by the intersection of MSB with MSC, which determines quantity $Q_{opt}$ and price $P_{opt}$.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed info-callout"><p>Welfare Loss</p><ul><li>Whenever there is an externality, there is a welfare (deadweight) loss, involving a reduction in social benefits, due to the misallocation of resources.</li><li>In the Figure, the shaded area represents the welfare loss arising from the negative production externality.</li><li>For all units of output greater than $Q_{opt}$, MSC > MSB, meaning that society would be better off if less were produced.
