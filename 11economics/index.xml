Macro-economics vs Micro-economics Macro-economics and Micro-economics are 2 of the largest subdivisions of the study of economics Micro- refers to the observation of small economics units Effects of government regulations on individual markets and consumer decision making Macro- refers to the “big picture” version of economics How interest rates are determined Why some economics grow faster than others Micro-economics Individual markets Consumers Producers/firrms Government How their actions influence decisions and individual markets Utility maximisation/satisfaction Firm production and profit maximisation Individual market equilibrium Effects of government regulations on individual markets Externalities and other side effects Macro-economics The big picture Focuses on aggregate production and consumption in an economy Effects of general taxes such as income and sales taxes on output and prices Causes of economics upswings and downturns Effects of monetary and fiscal policies on economics health Effects of, and process for, determining interest rates Causes for some economies growing faster than other economies Uses GDP (Gross Domestic Product: monetary value of all finished goods and services within a give time period) and goods and services by their market price Inflation, unemployment rate, GDP Scarcity We have unlimited wants and limited resources to satisfy those wwants There is a scarcity of resources Resources have alternative uses Basic Economic Problem (BEP) BEP is every and affects us all Due to the problem of “relative scarcity” Scarcity relative to our wants Resources may be abundant but wants are unlimited, how are the resources allocated: relative scarcity Due to scarcity, we are forced to make choices Resources cannot be used for all human wants We must choose We have unlimited wants, but there is a scarcity of resources to satisfy those wants.</description></item><item><title>Market Efficiency</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Economics/MarketEfficiency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Economics/MarketEfficiency/</guid><description>Go back
