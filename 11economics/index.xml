Price Floor Minimum price (lower price limit) allowed by legislation Government believes equilibrium price is too low Prices of all affected goods or services transacted cannot be below the minimum price allowed For a price floor to be effective, the legislated price, $P_{min}$, must be above the market equilibrium price Surplus occurs, as $Q_{supplied}&amp;gt;Q_{demanded}$ Quantity transacted will fall Consumer surplus will fall With government intervention, producers can earn more A minimum wage may help reduce the income gap between higher and lower wage earners Price Ceiling Opposite of a price floor Maximum price (upper price limit) allowed by legislation Prices of all affected goods or services transacted cannot be above the maximum price allowed For a price ceiling to be effective, the legislated price $P_{max}$ must be below the equilibrium price Shortage occurs, as $Q_{demanded} &amp;gt; Q_{supplied}$ What alternative means of resource allocation can replace the price mechanism, now that a price ceiling is imposed?</description></item><item><title>Application of Demand and Supply - Taxes and Subsidies</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/taxesandsubsidies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/taxesandsubsidies/</guid><description>go back

Measures of Economic Activity There are 3 ways to measure the value of aggregate output, suggested by the circular flow of income model, all giving rise to the same result Expenditure approach: Adds up all spending to buy final goods and services produced within a country over a time period $C+I+G+(X-M)$ Income approach: Adds up all income earned by the factors of production that reduce all goods and services within a country over a time period Output approach: calculates the value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a time period National Income National income: measures the monetary value of the flow of output of goods and services produced in an economy over a period of time You will not have to define this Main function of National Income Accounting is to provide data to analyse the overall performance of the economy Can be calculated in the 3 ways mentioned above Economics Growth Increasing capacity of an economy to satisfy the material wants of the population Growth is generally thought to be the most important macroeconomic objective because it determines the future opportunity set of the economy and enables households to achieve a higher standard of living in material terms Has 2 meanings Growth refers to an increase in the output that an economy produces over a period of time (actual growth) Growth also refers to an increase in what an economy can produce if it is using all its scarce resources (potential growth) An increase in potential growth can be shown by an outward shift in the PPF curve Gross Domestic Product The most frequency use measure of economic performance is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Defined as the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a given period of time(usually over a year) GDP does not measure PPF of an economy GDP numbers are of little importance in themselves Economists place importance on the rate of change in GDP (the rate of economic growth) Rate of growth: Percentage change in GDP growth Nominal GDP vs Real GDP Real GDP: Measures the money value of all goods and services produces within the territory adjusted for price changes</description></item><item><title>Income Distribution</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/IncomeDistribution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/IncomeDistribution/</guid><description>#cantbebotheredtocontinue

Occurs when the actions of consumers or producers give rise to negative or positive side effects on others who are not part of these actions, and whose interests are not taken into consideration People (not involved in the economic transaction) feeling the effects of an externality are often referred to as &amp;ldquo;third parties&amp;rdquo; If these side-effects (spillovers) on third parties involve benefits, there arises a positive externality, also known as external benefit If they involve costs in the form of side-effects (spillovers), there arises a negative externality, also known as external costs Externalities can arise from either consumption activities (consumption externalities) or producer activities (producer externalities) There are 4 types of externalities Negative Production Externalities Negative Consumption Externalities Positive Production Externalities Positive Consumption Externalities Marginal External Cost (MEC): Additional cost incurred by third parties who are not involved in the consumption and production of additional unit of the good Marginal Social Cost (MSC): MPC + MEC; Additional costs incurred by society&amp;hellip;.</description></item><item><title>Market Failure - Free and Public Goods</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/freeandpublicgoods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/freeandpublicgoods/</guid><description>#marketfailure

Negative Externalities of Production Government regulations Rely on &amp;ldquo;command&amp;rdquo; approach, using authority to enact legislation and regulations in the public&amp;rsquo;s interest Regulations can be used to prevent or reduce the effects of production externalities In the case of the polluting firm, regulations can forbid the dumping of certain toxic substances into the environment More commonly, regulations do not totally ban the production of pollutants, but rather attempt to achieve one of the following Limit the emission of pollutants by setting a maximum limit of pollutants permitted Limit the quantity of output produced by the producer Require polluting firms to install technologies reducing the emissions The impact is to lower the quantity of the good produced and bring it to the optimal supply curve by shifting MPC up to MSC Pollutant and output restrictions achieve this by forcing the firm to produce less.</description></item><item><title>Market Failure in Gas and Oil Market</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/Investigation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Economics/Investigation/</guid><description>go back
