Accuracy: How close your experimentally derived number is to the “true” or “real” quantity being measured
Precision: How the repeat values or a given trial are to each other, OR the fineness of the scale on the instrument being used to take measurements</description></item><item><title>Superposition</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/Superposition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/Superposition/</guid><description>Superposition occurs when 2 waves travelling in the same medium meet Their amplitudes combine algebraically to produce a resultant wave at that particular instant When the 2 waves superimpose, the resultant displacement of the particles is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual displacements of the original waves Constructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are in phase interfere/superimpose Resultant wave has an amplitude greater than each of the individual waves Equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves Application: Amplified Speakers When 2 speakers are made to produce the same sound, the sound waves produced interfere with each other Thus, at certain places (anti-nodes), constructive interference occurs, and the sound is louder (amplitude increases) At nodes, destructive interference occurs, and the sound is quieter (amplitude decreases) Destructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are not in phase meet and superimpose, crating a resultant wave that has amplitude lower than each of the individual waves Here the individual waves have positive and negative amplitudes, and so they combine to produce a wave of smaller amplitude Complete Destructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are completely not in phase, i.</description></item><item><title>Waves</title><link>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/Waves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nottaro.github.io/notes-dump/11Physics/Waves/</guid><description>go back
