Vibrations Vibration: Mechanical phenomenon where oscillation occurs around an equilibrium point Free Vibration: When a force is applied to any object, then that object is allowed to vibrate at its natural frequency Forced Vibration: When a force is applied to an object and it is forced to vibrate at a particular frequency Natural frequency: frequency at which an object vibrates when it is not disturbed by an outside force Resonance Resonance: Phenomenon that occurs where an object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency Energy is transferred from the forced oscillator to the receiver with maximum efficiency, and the amplitude of the vibration is increased greatly Modes of Vibration The different ways in which a system vibrates naturally/oscillates The frequency of oscillation is termed as modal frequency.</description></item><item><title>Dosimetry</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/Dosimetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/Dosimetry/</guid><description> When our cells are exposed to ionising radiation, this turns them into free radicals</description></item><item><title>Fission and Fusion</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/FissionFusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/FissionFusion/</guid><description> go back
Nuclear Fission Nucleus of an atom is bombarded with neutrons to split the heavier nucleus into smaller and lighter nuclei This makes the nucleus so unstable that it splits into 2 A lot of energy is released Occur artificially Little energy is required to split an atom Atomic bomb is based on concept of nuclear fission Often involves releases of gamma rays and free neutrons $$^1_0n+ ^{235}{92}U-&amp;gt;^{141}{56}Ba+^{92}_{36}Kr+3 ^1_0 n$$ Nuclear Fusion 2 or more lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus An enormous amount of energy is released, much larger than nuclear fission Occurs in stars and the sun Huge amount of energy is required to bring 2 atoms together Therefore, happens in very, very hot conditions Cold fusion is a concept that entails nuclear fusion happening at room temperature Hydrogen bomb is based on concept of nuclear fusion Usually releases neutrons or protons as well as new nucleus Strong magnetic field is required for magnetic confinement Ensures plasma doesn’t escape Confinement ensures that fusion occurs, and makes it safe</description></item><item><title>Force and Free Body Diagrams</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/Force/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/Force/</guid><description>go back

Mass defect The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the combined masses of the nucleons Mass defect: difference between total mass of the individual nucleons, and the mass of the nucleus as a whole  The difference in mass is considered to be the binding energy of the nucleus Binding Energy The difference in mass (mass defect) is considered to be binding energy If the mass of 4He was equal to the mass of 2 protons + 2 neutrons, the nucleus would fall apart without any input of energy To be stable, its mass must be less than that of its constituents combined  The nuclear binding energy represents the amount of energy that must be put into a nucleus to break it apart into its individual nucleons Equations SI units We can calculate the energy through $e=mc^2$ e = energy in J m = mass in kg c = speed of light, or 300 000 000 m/s Other units Sometimes, you&amp;rsquo;ll be given units in amu In this case, find the mass of all nucleons, and subtract the mass of the nucleus from that You should get a value in amu Multiply this by 931, and this will be the binding energy in MeV This can be converted into Joules using the data sheet formulas In short: $MeV = 931\times amu$</description></item><item><title>Momentum and Impulse</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/Momentum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/Momentum/</guid><description>go back

Car Safety Holding the mass of the car and the total change in velocity constant (as when braking you will always be breaking from a set speed), the impulse for the car will be constant as well, because $I=m\Delta v$ When a car breaks suddenly, as the non-seat-belt-wearing passengers have a tendency to maintain their path (inertia), they are flung forward until they collide with the front; at this point, a force acts on them to slow them down along with the car Crumple Zones When 2 cars collide, the crumple zone contracts (absorbing the impact force) and thus a retarding force is applied on the car through a larger amount of time.</description></item><item><title>Scalars and Vectors</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/ScaVec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/ScaVec/</guid><description>go back

Superposition occurs when 2 waves travelling in the same medium meet Their amplitudes combine algebraically to produce a resultant wave at that particular instant When the 2 waves superimpose, the resultant displacement of the particles is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual displacements of the original waves Constructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are in phase interfere/superimpose Resultant wave has an amplitude greater than each of the individual waves Equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves Application: Amplified Speakers When 2 speakers are made to produce the same sound, the sound waves produced interfere with each other Thus, at certain places (anti-nodes), constructive interference occurs, and the sound is louder (amplitude increases) At nodes, destructive interference occurs, and the sound is quieter (amplitude decreases) Destructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are not in phase meet and superimpose, crating a resultant wave that has amplitude lower than each of the individual waves Here the individual waves have positive and negative amplitudes, and so they combine to produce a wave of smaller amplitude Complete Destructive Interference 2 waves of equal frequency that are completely not in phase, i.</description></item><item><title>Ultrasound Imaging</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/UltrasoundImaging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/11Physics/UltrasoundImaging/</guid><description>go back
