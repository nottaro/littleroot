Innate Immunity Based on genetic make-up Relies on already formed components Rapid response: within minutes of infection Not specific Same molecules/cells respond to a range of pathogens Has no memory Same response after repeated exposure Does not lead to clonal expansion Clonal expansion: explosive increase in number of lymphocytes Mechanisms Mechanical barriers/surface secretion Skin Acidic pH in stomach Cilia Humoral mechanisms (mediated by macromolecules, e.</description></item><item><title>Pathogens</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Biology/Pathogens/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Biology/Pathogens/</guid><description>go back
Microorganisms that cause Disease Bacteria Majority of bacteria are non-pathogenic (harmless to humans) Some are pathogenic (cause disease) Essential to life on Earth Decomposition of organic material and cycling of elements In/on the human body, bacteria colonise the gut, mouth, skin, genitals and airways Single-celled microscopic (0.</description></item><item><title>The Body's Defences</title><link>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Biology/Defences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://littleroot.toomwn.xyz/10Biology/Defences/</guid><description>go back
Pathogens Pathogens are microbes  Micro-organism or other agent that causes disease Not all microbes are pathogens Many types of pathogens that are beneficial to organisms Vaccination Acts to increase the host’s resistance to an pathogen Administration of a material that stimulates adaptive immunity to a disease External Non-Specific Defences Skin Provides physical barrier to prevent pathogens from entering the body Dead skin cells are constantly sloughed off, making it difficult for invading bacteria to colonise Has low pH between 4.</description></item></channel></rss>
